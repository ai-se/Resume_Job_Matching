ACADEMIC PROJECTS AND SEMINARS
Design and Optimization of the Bell Housing Manufacturing Facility

Modeled a manufacturing facility for 6, 8, and 9 transmission bell-housings using Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation software
Carried out machine and tool selection by defining Takt time, MTBF, and MTTR required manufacturing and assembly processes of bell and bearing housings.
Optimized number of machines, workforce, and shift-timings for three different scenarios: (1) Ideal case, (2) Real case, (3) Demand fluctuations up to +/- 30% and developed KPI sheets accordingly

Comparative Assessment of WIPER and Standard Inserts on Surface Roughness and Tool Wear in Hard-turning of Titanium Alloy
Assessed the effects of different speeds, depth of cut, feed on tool wear (tool life) and surface roughness in machining (hard turning) of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V using CNC machining
Used Taguchi technique for design of experiment and gray relations, Gray Relational Coefficients and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied to study the performance characteristics
Calculated optimum values for performance parameters: Cutting speed (1200rpm), feed (0.15mm/rev), and depth of cut (0.1 mm)
