CAREER HISTORY
March 2002 – Nov 2010 Sonatrach E&P
Junior to Senior Reservoir Engineer
As part of the team of production engineering, we manage mature oil fields In Amenas Algeria under water injection to maintain reservoir pressure and well impairments solutions. My duties include:
Projects: I was the lead of the abandonment project of old wells in the region, I was responsible of the Tableau de bord production account, I manage a team of 10 persons
I was the interim of the technical puits chef service
Achieve a cost effective solutions to improve production from brown fields
Well performance optimization to reverse decline production from tight oil wells in brown fields, work over program: Cement squeeze, water shut off, well impairments remedial: casing deterioration, well re-completion
Artificial lift: gas lift optimization, involved in optimization of gas lift system using Pipesim
Contributing to water injection management strategy, mid and long term development schemes of the reservoir to maximize recovery
Production enhancement: reservoir stimulation, Matrix treatment Acidizing job design and supervision
Productions Operations programme elaboration and supervision
Planning, prioritization & sustaining continuous work over Rig strategy
Coaching fresh engineers and nationals Algerian from universities and institution

Nov -2010 – January 2017: JVGAS Sonatrach-Bp-Statoil Company
GAS project in Joint Venture (Sonatrach-Bp-Statoil).This project consist of three fields in Devonian reservoir and carboniferous, four other fields will come sooner in the Devonian reservoir named southern fields. My task in the project:

A single point contact between the field operations and the subsurface team, I manage the
Petroleum activities, responsible of surveillance plan execution: Step rate tests,
pressure build up, well surveillance, reach high performance in respect to gas nominations
Production optimization, well constraints identification and remedial programming:
Clean up, water loading issues, velocity string, water shut off
Artificial lift: gas well deliquification
Well performance and cost effective well impairments remediation
Fracing tight gas reservoir design using Stimplan simulator
Review all the simulation models and make good progress with all aspects of the project.
Prepare the most technical & economical scenario as basement of the reference case.
Generating VLP tables vertical wells using Prosper and surface network (GAP) to use in the
Built a multi-tank material balance model for different oil fields for the pre-screening study.
Well test interpretation-using PIE software, Kappa Engineering Sapphire.
Production forecast to meet daily gas demand

CO2 Monitoring project

Managing the CO2 monitoring both activities and the team in Krechba field. The operations are performed by international companies and researchers, the field activities are performed under our supervision to secure safely CO2 injection.

Six techniques are performed surface and subsurface, planning, contracts and execution are done every 1 to 2 years depending on the monitoring itself.
Gas sampling Q&A, CO2 injectors surveillance, Aquifer monitoring
Reporting and Contract renew, campaign plan and supervision to monitor the CO2 probable seepage
Management of Operations and technical meeting with experts and organism in the area of CO2 monitoring
Coach engineers and technicians to follow up operations on the field

January 2017- January 2018 (one year): Subsurface Team- GTFT Sonatrach-Repsol-Total
As part of subsurface team, we manage Condensate gas cap mature field, preparing Subsurface committee meetings, reservoir monitoring to deal with all well impairments issues related to water breakthrough and condensate baking (velocity string was one of the solution practiced for water unloading in the GTFT filed), reservoir surveillance, well test down hole and surface measurement for material balance.

End January 2018 till today: Subsurface Team - Sonatrach-PVEP-PTTEP
As part of subsurface team, we manage a new developed oil field Bir Seba Algeria which will be under water injection and gas lift to maintain reservoir pressure, in addition to well impairments solutions dealing with wax issues, asphalting and salts on daily basis. My duties include:
-Elaborate and update the FDP phase-2 (drilling 20 wells to increase production, implementing water injection)
-Perform production forecast and profiles and scenarios using Petrel-RE
-Well test interpretation, PLT using Kappa sapphire and Emeraude
-Fracing jobs, design (Petrel-Re) and evaluation
