Employment & Personal Projects

Oct 17 – Aug 19
Beijer Electronics (Malmö, Sweden) – Software Development Engineer

At Beijer, our team had 2 core responsibilities as we developed our IioT platform: 1) Our dashboard product - a customizable web app for visualizing data transmitted though Azure from IoT devices on factory floors in remote locations. 2) The services, APIs and infrastructure to handle data transmission to/from Azure, licensing and user/device/data management.

Tech Stack: .Net Core, EmberJs, Qunit, SASS, xUnit, NSubstitute, TeamCity, Azure Functions, Azure IoT Hub

Specific Achievements:
• Built microservices which allowed us to create and enforce licensing, and accept or reject telemetry data from factory devices based on the validity of a device’s license.
• Developed a real-time, animated chart, which displayed live values for multiple data points received from Azure through a WebSocket connection. Featured smooth scrolling as the user-specified time interval elapsed.
Was our most popular data-display graphic on the dashboard product during beta-testing, based on customer feedback.
• Helped increase code coverage of the entire JavaScript code base from 40 to 70% during Summer 2018.
• Collaborated with another teammate to create the Azure function apps to handle the processing of incoming telemetry data from IoT devices so that it could be stored in Azure Blob Storage, ready for later use whenever a dashboard project was loaded and subsequently requested the latest telemetry, or a historical record of past data.
This allowed us to move away from mocking the main function or selling point of our product, and set it up legitimately so that it could now be monetized in production, with real customers.
• Led the creation of a web API to manage dashboard projects on an organizational and user level. According to feedback from 20 surveyed beta-customers, this made them feel safer about using the product, as they no longer needed to bookmark links, and they were no longer worried that unauthorized users could access their dashboard if they obtained a link in dishonest circumstances..

Sep 16 – May 17
Fastcom Telecom (Sligo, Ireland) – Technical Support Engineer Fastcom provides network traffic monitoring for businesses and internet for residential customers.

Tech Stack: JavaScript, Java

Specific Achievements:
• Developed a script which notified specified admin(s) whenever a device on a business’ network attempted to communicate outward to a known blacklisted IP address.
• Through being proactive and regularly checking in with customers, was able to learn about and address customer issues before they became critical. 6 customers called or wrote to say that it was a key factor in them deciding to stay, saving the company $4000 in 2016-17.
• 85% of 300 surveyed customers said they preferred dealing with our tech support team, than that of any other competitor they have previously been a customer with. It’s worth noting we were a 3-person team.

Mar 15 – Aug 15
Fastcom Telecom (Sligo, Ireland) – Web Developer Internship Tech Stack: Java, JavaScript, D3JS, CSS

Specific Achievements:
• Built a self-updating system of known blacklisted IP addresses.
• Built a system which would connect to different remote towers via SSH, run shell commands to record various network-related info, then be used to create email alerts for business customers.
• Built a system which analyses outgoing traffic to known blacklisted IPs and builds a graphic from that data to allow for easy identification of the most severe threats to the system. Proved useful for many of our business clients who we provided internal network monitoring to.
• Created an email alert system so that admins and other relevant bodies were informed of blacklist hits on the network in a timely, effective manner.
