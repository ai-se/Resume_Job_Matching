Delta Systems Inc
USA, Ohio,Cleveland (http://www.deltasystemsinc.com) May/15- Till Now Industrial Engineer
Currently, I work as industrial engineer at Delta Systems Inc (http://www.deltasystemsinc.com). At Delta, I’m working on several projects where I'm applying six sigma approaches to achieve ultimate performance. I have successfully completed more 28 six sigma projects. The vast majority of the completed projects were in in the area of manufacturing and production lines. However, I have also expanded my role to reach out to different departments such as Tooling, HR, Inventory Management, and IT departments . In general, I’m excellent in studying the martial flow, set a work instruction, perform simulation, time and motion studies, time and material waste reduction, data analysis, identify areas of low efficiency and then systematically improve them. Mainly in the area of the process and continuous improvement using the latest six sigma tools & software’s.
• Appling lean six sigma concepts & tools to maintain continuous improvements.
• Leading, mentoring, coaching all the continuous improvements and Six Sigma projects in all department.
• Designing an methodology that is depending on Six Sigma DAMIC approach to deliver all the Eyad Almaghariz

objective for each project.
• Leading most of cost saving projects.
• Design experiments, collecting data, conducting time studies, design new tools that increase the efficiency and cut the labor cost and time.
• Justifying any expense (such as new machine or new tools) based on cost saving or/and the The quality that will be provided to Delta.
• Team member in all the company new projects or new product. Key Successes Include:
• Increased the efficiency in one machine from 25% to 85% after I applied a six sigma tools to resort the machine to its original efficiency (2017).
• Increase the efficiency in one of the manual lines from 65% to 95 % after I did a time study (2017)
• Cutting the cost on one of the lines by $41,000 on the first year(2017).
• As six sigma black belt I led and managed a large cross founcunal team to increase one of the semiautomated lines. The result was increasing the machine efficiency from 71% to 98%, identifying all the root cause of customer returns and direct cost saving of $102,000.(2018)
• Total cost reduction of $335,000 as results of various Six-Sigma projects .(2016)
• Inventing new tools for production that fit the jobs and cut the cost.
• Converting two manual production lines to fully automated ones. That was started by creating the business case for the projects and calculating the long terms cost benefits (Feasibility Study). And then Approved for $1.65Mill and$ 0.625 Mill. Lead and managed the projects till we received the customer approved PPAP. Currently the automation lines are working on the floor with full capacity. Resulting in expected direct cost saving of $690,000/Y & $275,000/Y respectively. (2018- 2019)
• Leading all the effort of implementing the use of 3D printing and additive manufacturing .
• Leading and mentoring group of engineering student for their graduation projects.
• Leading the implementation of all the effort of transitioning to paperless process across our organization

Master of Science, Industrial Engineering
Youngstown State University; GPA (3.84); May. 2015
Bachelor of Industrial Engineering
The Hashemite University; July 2008
• Master Thesis : Cost and economic analysis of using the Additive Manufacturing technology in sand casting industry, The project developed an empirical method to measure the geometric complexity of several case studies. The output of the project helped many foundries to make an accurate decision about when to use the Additive Manufacturing based on the part’s complexity.
• Bachelor Graduation Project: Lean management at ARAMEX (Local Cargo Company), the project includes working on Supply Chain & Network to find opportunity to reduce time. The project was concentrated on the transportation and cargo problems in order to improve the delivery time during overall process with the least cost and maximum customer’s satisfaction.
