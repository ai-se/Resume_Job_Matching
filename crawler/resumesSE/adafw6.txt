Description:
Its presents the results of the laboratory investigation on the effects of replacing cement with ground granulated blast furnace slag and river sand with Quarry Dust in concrete on the compressive strength and split tensile strength of concrete. GGBS is used to replace the cement from 10% to 70% at increments of 20% and Quarry Dust was used to replace the sand from 20% to 80% at increments of 20%. For this study, M30 grade of concrete were adopted and designed by IS Code method.
