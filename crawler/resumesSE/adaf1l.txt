OBJECTIVE
Seeking for an entry level position as a structural engineer where I can apply my Engineering, leadership and business development skills with a professional growth. I aspire to work in your company and very much interested in getting involve with the working culture of your company. EDUCATION
SKILLS
• Software Skills: AutoCAD, Staad.Pro, Abaqus CAE, ETABS (basic).
• Programming Skills: C, C++.
ACADEMIC PROJECTS
• Behavior of Reinforced Concrete Beams Wrapped with Hybrid Fiber Reinforced Polymers.
Analyzed the flexural behavior of RC beams using Hybrid Carbon and Aramid Fiber Reinforced Polymer sheets at the soffit of beams by experimental investigations and ABAQUS CAE modeling. Results showed an improved load carrying capacity for beams with Hybrid FRP sheets than control beam and beams strengthened with single type of FRP sheets.
• Effect of Z- Shaped GI Wire Fiber on Concrete Strength.
Concluded that the use of Z-shaped GI wire fibers in place of Normal Steel Fibers can improve the quality of concrete in terms of compressive strength, tensile strength, bending and shear strength.
• FEM Analysis of Short CFRP-Reinforced Steel Tubular Compression Member.
Determined and analyzed the buckling characteristics of short CFRP-Reinforced Steel Tubular Columns using ABAQUS CAE. Results stated that the Local Buckling occurs less as compare to Standard Steel Tubular Compression Member.
INTERNSHIP AND CONFERENCES
• Underwent 5 months project internship at Larsen & Toubro Construction, Manapakkam, Chennai.
• Presented a paper on title “Behaviour of Reinforced Concrete Beams Wrapped with Hybrid Fiber Reinforced Polymers” at the International Conference on Industry 4.0 and Advancements in Civil Engineering i4ACE’19, PSG iTech, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu.
• Attended Inplant-Taining at Sathanur Dam (Thiruvanamalai), CSIR- SERC (Taramani), Sewage Treatment Plant (Koyambedu).
