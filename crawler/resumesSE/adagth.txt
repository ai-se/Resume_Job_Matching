Course Project
Autonomous Truck Parking
Multidisciplinary Design Program with ISUZU, University of Michigan Jan. 2019 – present
• Ran autonomous truck parking simulation on CARLA simulator
• Designed robot navigation architecture for a four-wheeled robot with ROS
• Processed and used encoder data for robot localization ORB Visual SLAM
Artificial Intelligence Application in EE, University of Michigan Jan. 2019 – Apr. 2019
• Built ORB Visual SLAM algorithm by calculating stereo visual odometry and optimizing it with loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.
• Used bag of words to detect loop closure, and least square error to do the pose graph optimization given loop closure information.
Warehouse Robot
Embedded System Experiment, National Taiwan University Feb. 2017 – Jun. 2017
• Created a system of two line-following robots, which first recognized the objects’ color, and created collision-free paths for robots to reach certain goals
• Built the system with Arduino and Raspberry-Pi by using Python and C++
