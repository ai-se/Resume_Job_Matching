Work history

Accraply Inc.
Field service engineer
**-** ** *******

While at Accraply I have done multiple jobs.
The first 6 years was strictly traveling to customer plants and repairing machines, adding upgrades, training and setup.
I went to the production floor for a year, still made gold in airline status. Preferred the traveling and service aspect of the job a lot more.
Back to service for 3 years traveling full time.
For the last 10 years I travel some but took over the phone support and scheduling of the service techs. This makes me the one the techs are calling from the field for support. This is a lot harder than troubleshooting the equipment. Trying to get the customer to see what you are referring too and get proper feedback on what the machine is doing from the customer can be difficult.

Tasks;
Phone support,
installation of new machine and upgrades,
training and repair of automated labeling machines.

Skills;
Plc programming mainly Allen Bradley,
Mechanical modification of machine, as a tech I do what it takes to get up and running
Electrical and mechanical troubleshooting, I have a degree in electronics but am quite mechanical as well.
I think on my feet, of the techs working for Accraply I can say that I think on my feet and want to fix the machine without help, if at all possible, from anyone else. Some techs are not like that, they want me or engineering to make all the decisions for them.

Negatives, every tech has both positive and negative attributes. Putting the right tech on the right job can be hard, here are mine.
I am a not the best trainer, my problem is I know multiple ways to do things and when I train I tell them the various ways. I tell the customer to use a way that works for them. This is bad because a lot of customers only want to hear one way to do a task.
I do not like training large groups. I get nervous if there are too many people watching me. I have trained up to 40 people in a class room before but I prefer 1 to 5 people at the machine. I could never be a public speaker.
My desk is a mess, although I know where everything is and it is a revolving mess.
I am a programmer and can do board level repair but I am not an engineering level programmer. I make changes as needed for production and upgrades but have never started a program from scratch.
When I make modifications, I tend to look at what I have on hand and how to make that work, rather than the best way to do it and what materials we need to get.
