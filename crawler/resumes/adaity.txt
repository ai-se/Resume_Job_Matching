SSC from Gurukul (03/2008-03/2009)
Completed 10-th and scored 95 percent, according to the curriculum of C.B.S.E Graduation Project
Our team modelled ‘Active Yaw Control system (AYC)', an automotive Electro-mechanical system in 'Matlab and Simulink' .We simulated the working of this system on a chosen Vehicle model and studied its effects on vehicle handling. We also suggested a new conceptual design of a 'Torque Vectoring Differential’, to be used in the system and showed it’s certain advantages over the existing design. Pre-final year Project
Demonstrated the operation and the special features of a particular transmission system of an Hybrid Electric vehicle ‘Toyota Prius’ called as 'Hybrid Synergy drive' .This system is an electronic Continuously Variable Transmission (e-CVT), and I analysed its structure and working using lever models for the Epicyclic gear systems.
