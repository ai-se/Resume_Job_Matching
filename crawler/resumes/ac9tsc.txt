PROJECTS:

6TH SEMESTER:

ECO-FRIENDLY WELDING BY HYDROGEN FUEL CELL:
Mostly all the countries are doing research in the development of renewable sources of energy to replace the fossil fuel as it is lacking day by day . So there in this project paper we are going to discuss about the use of hydrogen fuel cell for effective welding torch. As most of the welding is done either by the gas or by electricity directly. This paper shows the use of an electrolysis process in which water splits into hydrogen & oxgyen when electricity is supplied to it, which is further used as a flame for welding.

8TH SEMSETER:

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF DIESEL ENGINE WITH THE ADDITION OF HYDROGEN:
The environmental pollution particularly the air pollution plays an major role in global warming. The unburnt hydrocarbon(HC),carbon monoxide(CO),nitrogen oxides (NOX),sulphur oxides (SO2) etc.. present in the vehicle emission plays a major role in air pollution. In this project we fabricated a hydrogen dry cell to produce HHO gas of 6 liters per minute. The HHO gas is supplied to engine through the air in-take manifold. The HHO gas is well mixed with diesel after compression stroke. Now in combustion,the HHO gas is used to burn the HYDROCARBON effectively so the more power can be created from diesel molecules. And the pollution like unburnt hydrocarbon,others can be reduced . The performance and emmission test are conducted.
