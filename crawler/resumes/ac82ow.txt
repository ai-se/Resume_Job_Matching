I am writing to express my interest in the Entry Level Drafter position for a client in Round Rock that you have posted online.
I feel confident I have the qualifications to be successful in this role. I have worked extensively with Solidworks and other modeling software for the past two years while working towards my Associate of Applied Science Degree in Computer Aided Design at ACC. I will receive my AAS degree in December 2019. I have completed all of my Computer Aided Design coursework with only two electives remaining to graduate. I will take the spring semester off, and take my two remaining courses in the fall when the classes I want are offered in the evenings.
During my professional career, I have learned that hard work, punctuality and open communications are the essential keys to success without which an individual and even a corporation cannot succeed. I am always willing to work beyond normal working hours to keep up with project timelines and production requirements. I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and discuss how my skills would fit in with the needs of your company. Attached is a resume for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Craig Tieman
