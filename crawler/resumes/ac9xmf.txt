CARPENTER/INSTALLATION SPECIALIST,
A & D RENOVATIONS (2017-2018)
LOVELACE SERVICE CO. (2009-2012)
My Daily tasks for each of these company’s was to remodel, construct, install or repair any and all household products including appliances, wood work, flooring, roofing, drywall work, painting, and much more. The objective of each job through my eyes was to walk into a project seeing the worst of a situation and constructing/remodeling/repairing the problem to the point where not only the customer was satisfied, but I would need a sense of satisfaction for myself in order for a job to be properly completed and professionally done. MARCH 2016 – JULY 2017
OPERATOR (MACHINE OPERATOR & FORKLIFT OPERATOR),
HOOVER TREATED WOOD PRODUCTS INC.
This company was highly particular on production. My duties as a machine (Stacker) operator were to mechanically stack plywood/lumber to be treated, stocked and/or shipped. Layer count was the primary focus which is how many layers of wood the operator and his crew can stack and prepare for treatment/shipment during each shift. If the production rate wasn’t up to standards, the office would usually make a change in operators because of the importance of production at Hoover. I also spent time as a forklift operator at this same Plant. The duties of a driver consist of, but aren’t limited to, loading/unloading the stacker machines with whatever product they are running that day, stocking the yard with wood that has been stacked for treatment, loading/unloading the kilns in order to dry the wood and prepare it for shipment.

ALTHEIMER LUMBER COMPANY (2001-2006)
My Grandfather owned and operated this company for forty plus years. I started working for him in Jr high school and learned various tricks of the trade. This is where I learned to provide 2
customer service, I became familiar with lumber and plywood, as well as hardware, household appliances, paint and the many other items that my grandfather’s company had to offer. I first learned how to operate a forklift which mainly consisted of loading/unloading flatbed trucks for shipping/receiving. I was basically taught how the lumber business works as it pertains to the products, but more importantly how it pertains to the customer. I have been involved in construction for many years due to the fact of my grandfather being a contractor and having a lumber company, having two uncles with construction businesses, and working with various individuals that were friends and colleagues of my family. They all specialized in construction and remodeling and I have learned quite a bit over the years and just wanted to express that in this description.
