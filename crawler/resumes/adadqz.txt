I consider myself a loyal,hard working person with very good communication skills and I am willing to work with all walks of life. I am a team player, enthusiastic, spontaneous and always looking forward to helping people and to a new challenge. I motivate myself to learn and expand my knowledge in my working environment. I can work under pressure with a capability of prioritizing and organizing my workplace and day to day duties. I am used to working long hours (12 hour shifts) in a building with 11 floors (the stairs can get tricky if you're not used to it). I am a fast learner and I an fascinated about other cultures and find it interesting. I strive to meet people from different cultures and learn more about them.
