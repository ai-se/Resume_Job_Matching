Thank you for taking the time to review my resume for the opportunity to allow me to become a valuable member of your team provided my skills and experience match the qualities you seek to fill the employment opportunity which you have available. I am a hard working individual who is a team player and has extensive experience and a successful track record in each position I have held over the course of my career. I have only worked for 2 organizations but have been promoted many times and held multiple titles in the manufacturing industry and never been terminated or laid off which I believe is due to my work ethic and commitment to my work and a loyalty to both my fellow co-workers and employer.
