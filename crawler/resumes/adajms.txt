PROJECT :
On going project:
• Character Device Driver Development:
Registering tour driver with standard kernel functions, providing Major and Minor numbers.
Exporting Dynamic Kernel Modules into the Kernel and utilizing them from other modules.
Project Completed:
• Client server communication using Sockets:
Designing FTP client server architecture using threads and Sockets in which multiple client can access the server.
Processing using Socket and threads with AF_UNIX and AF_INET as communication domains.
Server creates a new thread for desling with each new client that come fresh out of the Listen Queue,So now each client will be catered to by a new thread.
• Client and Server Model using IPC and Threads
Implementing a Server program where some clients (requesting clients) would send a request to the server and server would further find the appropriate client (processing clients) to process the request.
Server invokes new client(processing client) so as to process the request. And to avoid data being sent through wrong path semaphores are used to set the sequence synchronization techniques.
Processing client then processes the data accepted from the server after processing client sends the result back to the server using Message queues
• Multiple data compression and decompression techniques using C Project comprises of master array which help us to get the compressed file and using the same master array the bits are then decompressed and original information is extracted. The project aims to remove ASCII code based data redundancy in the provided source file so as to trim the entire file and at the same time encode it with our algorithm in order to encrypt the data.
• Client and Server communication using pipes and FIFO: Implementing a Server program where some clients (requesting clients) would send a request to the server and server would further find the appropriate client
(processing clients) to process the request.
Server invokes the new client (processing client) so as to process the request.
