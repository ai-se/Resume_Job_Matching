Hi dude! I'm a hardware technician looking for some awesome jobs in the LA area
to support my family. I have two kids, they're both dogs and they like to have fun.
They also like to run around and play in the sun. I'm trying to hit the limit rn but
I cannot hit it if I do not keep on trying to hit it.
