MOTIVATIONAL NOTE :
I am based at the Masonite/Evowood Plant in Estcourt.I work independently and report directly to my IT Manager based at our Head Office in Durban.I am a very enthusiastic person with great goal achievements. The ability to perform many tasks allocated at the same time, is my way of having a "good day at the office" and also producing new and exciting challenges in my path to success. I can assure you that once I am on board your company, there will be many positive outlooks and lots of gain.
I believe that in today's world there is no such thing as “winning and losing” but rather “winning and learning”. Always remember that success is a progressive realization of a worthy goal.
With my combined knowledge of IT and HR, I believe that this places me in a more positive role whereby multitasking in two different areas of experience is required.

Thank you kindly.
