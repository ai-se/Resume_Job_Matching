EDUCATION & TRAINING

INSTITUTION : HIGH TECHNICAL SCHOOL
RUSTENBURG
QUALIFICATION : STD 8
YEAR COMPLETED : 1981

With 28 years of experience in performing rigging duties, and extensive knowledge of rigging equipment and their capacities, I am just the right candidate for the position of a Rigger/ Ropesman. I am confident that I can provide your organization with the expertise that it needs from a person in this position.

As noted on Resume, I am highly skilled in inspecting all applicable rigging, planning for lifts using the weight of the load, and able to estimate the lifting capacity of the equipment. Moreover, I possess advanced transportation knowledge with regards to moving equipment and materials from one point to another, able to attach load through slings, chains, cables, hooks, shackles and other interconnected tools.

I have the ability to work as part of a team but I am also self-motivated with the ability to perform my duties independently. I have lots of patience and I pay close attention to detail so I notice the small things that can make a big difference if not handled correctly.
I have excellent communication skills, problem- solving abilities, great eyesight and I am physically able to meet the requirements of this demanding job.
