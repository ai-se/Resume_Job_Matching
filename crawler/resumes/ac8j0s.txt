MACHINIST

Machinist /Manual horizontal and vertical, offering 18+ years Machining and setup of some complex machine part features experience with a wide range of versatile experience in industrial and military settings. Expertise in manual machining with more than 18 years of part setup, machining and part feature measuring for final product output, noted for completing unusually difficult assignments ahead of target delivery dates. Eager to learn new technologies as evidenced by continued education and recognized achievements. Excellent interpersonal and communication skills, both verbal and written. Easily establishes rapport with co-workers and is able to work as a team member or independently. Excellent research and field expertise with speeds and feeds and tooling selection for optimal production output without compromising tooling integrity. Strong attention to detail with aptitude for learning and implementing new technology. I can set up and utilize cylindrical grinder’s for tool sharpening as well.

WORK HISTORY
Machinist
A.G. Russel Co, Inc, E Hartford, Ct

Set up and machining with horizontal mills, Bridgeport, lathes and surface grinders for metal engraving stamps and die holding tools.
Applies knowledge of tool and die design and construction, shop mathematics, metal properties, and layout, machining and part measuring procedures while working to tolerances to the ten thousandth. Provide knowledge and hand grind drills, end mills and shell mill tooling when time constraints are prevented.

Assistant Validation Design Engineer
Artech Information Systems, Morristown, NJ -2016

6 month Contract Work responsible for validating designs, models, tooling fixtures and machine assemblies and provide electronic data packages for product data management.

Used Solidworks Parametric Modeling CAD and PLM structuring skills to develop engineer/manufacturing documents and electronic libraries in support of past/future jobs.
Preformed validation and insure accuracy of past and on going work using core experience.
Designed, reverse engineered and manufactured unprocurable blue print revisions for electronic libraries.
Developed electronic data files and installed administrative vault structuring.

Senior Electrical/Mechanical Designer
General Dynamics-Electrical Boat, Groton Ct 1980-2014

Designed and validated both electrical and mechanical components used in today’s shipbuilding industry utilizing Catia V4 and Catia V5. Responsible for accurate raceway layouts, cabling, hangers, related components and pipe design.

• Created 3D drawings and models for applications on ship systems and companies design library data base for years to come
• Created 3 dimensional components, power control modules, power boxes, support equipment and hardware.
• Provided hydraulic and fitting design details for manufacturing and use in contract procurements
• Designed connectivity models for power and signal distribution on new ship construction
• Optimized a cabling system that facilitated the installation of cabling and wire bundling from external applications
• Reinforced changes to living documents from previous installations eliminating potential errors on future contracts

Work History, continued

Inside Machinist
Responsible for the fabrication and repair of an array of submarine parts manufactured from exotic metals, and serviceability of assigned equipment. Responsible for the precision measurement and accuracy of manufactured parts.

•. Fabricated highly technical and difficult parts utilizing manual vertical and horizontal milling centers
•. Repaired damaged parts and broken tools using Electric Disintegrating machines (EDM) and manual equipment
•. Using precision equipment and hand measuring devices verified quality and tolerances of manufacture parts.

KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Certified in 3 CAD software programs with a proven record of learning new technologies
• Hand picked by management to join the Senior Mechanical Design Team for his vast knowledge in machining and reasoning.
• Loaned out to the Cableways Department for his design capabilities reducing the backlog by months completed all assigned
work ahead of scheduled and within budget
• Single handedly tracked, analyzed and reverse engineered over 300 cables for downstream applications that were deleted
from the living database files. This act prevented inferior installs long costly delays and possible system failures.
• Responsible for working with fluid engineers with little time allowance to design a water round torpedo tank piping
diffuser without compromise to structural integrity or reduction of turbulence.
• Took the challenge to the extreme by providing the conception to and integration of accurately detailed data files on time.
• Transferred to Electrical Design utilizing my experience, CAD knowledge, systematic reasoning and team building skills.
• Team member of a design group responsible for designing piping and cable arrays used in submarines both USA and U.K.
Designed electrical components for the electrical library of design components and arrangements of 3D mockups. This not only saves time but allows future designers to simulate the component thus insuring proper fit, function and cost reduction prior to build thus reducing delay build mistakes.
• Responsible for successful completion of all electronic file development, validation processes and used in administrated vault
structuring. Completed all assigned work ahead of scheduled, reduced and streamlined electronic and paper files.
