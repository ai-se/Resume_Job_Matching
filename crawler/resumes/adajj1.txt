Title: PSMPA: Patient Self-controllable and Multi-level Privacy-preserving Authentication in Healthcare System.

Description: Distributed m-healthcare system significantly facilitates efficient patient treatment for medical consultation by sharing personal health information among healthcare providers. However, it brings about the challenge of keeping both the data confidentiality and patientsâ€™ identity privacy simultaneously. Many existing access control and anonymous authentication schemes cannot be straight forwardly exploited.

S/W Tool: Php with Mysql, xampp, Apache Server.

B.sc Project: -

Title: A New Algorithm for Inferring User Search Goals with Feedback Sessions.

Description: An ambiguous query, different users may have different search goals when they submit it to a search engine. The inference and analysis of user search goals can be very useful in improving search engine relevance and user experience. In this project we developed a novel approach to infer user search goals by analyzing search engine query logs. First, we construct a framework to discover different user search goals for a query by clustering the proposed feedback sessions.
Tools: Java, Net and SQL Server 2005.
