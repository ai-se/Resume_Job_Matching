Dear Sir,
Your job posting for a Human Resources Manager caught my attention because my HR management experience has been matching with what you are looking for, so I am familiar with the challenges. In addition to leading the HR department, I am a strategic business partner in my current position and serve on the executive team.
My 22 years in HR as regional manager, have allowed me to grow and develop professionally and as a leader.
You are seeking an individual with a strong passion to innovate and drive for solutions. Since I started the HR department from scratch in my current organization and have led the adoption of all people processes, systems, policies, and procedures, I qualify. Personal accountability for results and my integrity are respected and unquestioned. I established a performance development and career planning process that utilizes both internal and external development opportunities for employees including mentoring, job-shadowing, team leadership, and classes.
I am most anxious to join an organization where HR is respected and where I can continue to provide input to the strategic business issues while implementing forward thinking HR and talent management strategies. Your advertised position appears to fit my experience, accomplishments, and education.
I am anxious to contribute to a new organization with the same energy, creativity, and commitment that I have brought to my past positions. Looking for a chance to interview with your team,
Regards,
Sincerely,
Bassam
