SUMMARY
Over 15 years experience performing project deployments of POS, PC and server refreshes occasionally as lead. These assignments often create time sensitive troubleshooting situations that may go beyond the scope of the project. Some of these projects have required air travel or long commutes and overnight stays. There are, more often than not, several layers of customers and contacts that need to be satisfied which creates an environment requiring an extremely high level of performance. I have a proven ability to work proficiently in this environment which demonstrates a high level of professionalism and competence.
