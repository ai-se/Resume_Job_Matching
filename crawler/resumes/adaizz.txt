Alexandros Koutsoukos
OBJECTIVE
An ambitious MSc student in Aerospace Engineering with extreme passion in Aerodynamics and CFD. My enthusiasm originates from the challenge to simulate and manage the interaction of air flow with humans’ creations and implement them efficiently and innovatively. Thus, driven by my tendency to excellence and highly-motivated personality, I am seeking for a challenging career in the state-of-the-art industry.
