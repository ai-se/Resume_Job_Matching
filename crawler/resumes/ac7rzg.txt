I am a skilled welder with 10 plus years of professional experience even though I have been working with metal all my life. I am certified in welding, fabrication, heavy equipment operation and have a very wide skill set. I have worked in various types of jobs so I have extensive knowledge in repairing things and getting jobs completed efficiently and correctly. I am willing to relocate and I am currently searching for a better work opportunity in an environment where I can not only use the skill set I currently have but also improve and expand it.
