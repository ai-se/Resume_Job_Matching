I have over 20 years of Customer Service and Sales experience. I have the ability to multitask in a very face paced work environment. In the past I have worked for a high volume call center to help students that were struggling to pay their student loans qualify for a forbearance or deferment. I was a Clinique Beauty Consultant for 2 years and worked on commission. I started out waitressing and absolutely love the fast pace life in the food industry. I also worked as a Pharmacy Technician for 5 years without a certificate and I learned a great deal about health insurance and pharmaceuticals. I no longer keep my Registered Nursing License current due to being a stay at home mom since 2014 so I am very excited to be changing my career path. I really enjoy Customer Service and Sales so if you are looking for an energetic employee that is goal oriented, organized, and punctual I am the employee for you. Authorized to work in the US for any employer
