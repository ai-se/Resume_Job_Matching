To Whom It May Concern,
I am an experienced Mac administrator located in Fairfax, VA. With over 18 years working directly for Apple, I have an intimate knowledge of macOS and iOS support. For the past three years, I have been the Lead IT Support Specialist and Mac Engineer at a prestigious private school, responsible for maintaining and deploying a ﬂeet of 1200 Apple devices, and resolving support tickets from students, faculty, and staff. I am also Jamf certiﬁed in both the 200 and 300 levels, and have experience administering G Suite for education, and managing user access leveraging Active Directory. Currently, I am looking for a chance to develop my career and grow my skills. While I have learned a lot in my current role, I’m interested in the opportunity that The Motley Fool has to offer. I have heard a lot about the unique culture there, and the job description on your website shows a lot of ability for innovation, automation, and improvement. With my past Mac management experience and top notch customer service training, I think I would be a strong member of your tier two support team. I’m looking forward to ﬁnding out if I’m a match for this position. Thanks,
Bill Kuhl

SUMMARY
I am a highly contributing employee who helps nourish a culture of teamwork and feedback among my peers.With over 18 years of experience working at Apple Inc., I have an intimate knowledge of Apple products and have integrated it with my passion for education. This has helped me greatly during my time as an IT Support Technician at Flint Hill School. I have a thirst for knowledge and learning about the latest tech which is the reason I still work for Apple part time. At Flint Hill I have many responsibilities ranging from troubleshooting software, repairing Macs, controlling content on the network through the web ﬁlter, and managing devices using Jamf Pro’s MDM solution. I am part of the team that manages and supports the One-to-One program for the Macs and iPads. Primarily, my time is spent planning for purchases, supervising device distribution, and facilitating the roll out of new technology through Apple DEP and Apple School Manager. Along with that, I help ﬁnd solutions to problems and answers to questions pertaining to the program. I am currently testing, planning and ﬁnalizing the roll out of our Two-to-One program for the middle school, where each student will have both an iPad and a MacBook Air to use for their studies. At Apple I help direct, lead, and grow a very technical group of Mac Geniuses. I have comprehensive experience with sales ranging from individual consumer to large companies with the business team. I also have expertise in inventory management, leadership, and continued motivation and training of my peers. Throughout my time at Apple I have played a key role in launching, promoting and supporting world- changing products and services. As one of the original Apple retail employees, I had the privilege of going through highly specialized training for interacting with customers and facilitated in creating a credo that ties the customer’s needs as a ﬁlter for everything we do. I personally collaborated with Steve Jobs on ‘Project Nexus’; the planning and launch of Apple’s retail endeavor. As of today, Apple Retail is critical to their success and responsible for almost $100 billion dollars a year of net revenue; helping it become the world’s most valuable company. The training and on boarding process I have experienced leads me to ﬁrmly believe that when working with a customer, I’m not just providing service- it’s about giving each person an experience that will enrich their life. This has always proved beneﬁcial to me at creating rapport, establishing relationships and building trust with people of all ages. EXPERIENCE
