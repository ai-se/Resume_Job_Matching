-My performance was amongst the top of the company, let alone the store, with my sales in the Stubs membership. I was recognized during the multiple seasons that I worked there repeatedly as being one of the best and being very speedy and efficient so as I became one of the go-to employees for assisting in any areas that needed aid.
