I am a hands-on, highly motivated, result-focused mechanical detail designer with over twenty-five years in design and product development. I have over 40,000 hours of CAD/CAM experience. My proficiencies involve design, manufacturing, and production process, especially to sheet metal (knowledge of bend tolerances & allowances) fabrication, plastics, extrusions, casting/molds, precision machine components, and electro-mechanical. I assist and implement cost-reducing innovations (value-engineering) at every giving opportunity and focus on systemic process efficiencies and improvements. My responsibilities require my involvement in interdepartmental resolutions and as an effective liaison successfully completed such tasks. My objectives include but not limited to overcome any technical and administrative obstacles to maintain scheduling and client satisfaction. I also conduct assessments, negotiations, and coordinate with vendors and sub-contractors nationally and abroad. Abilities are as listed:
• In-depth organizational skills (operational detailing, drafting, and design standard procedures)
• Task prioritization, communications, and delegations of projects.
• Supervision of multiple tasks/projects.
• Generate design-concept and prototype presentations.
• Solid, surface and assembly modeling.
• 3D modeling of manufactured components and assemblies.
• Generate B.O.M.’s E.C.O.’s Installation instruction sheets and required documentation. Feel free to contact me for any questions.
Many thanks for your time and consideration
