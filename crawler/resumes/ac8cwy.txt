Recommendations:

David Thatcher
Variable-cost based market entry and growth into the Middle East
October 19, 2015, David managed Rito directly

Rito was recruited to head-up a business development project in a venture with BP in the Philippines. He has a solid understanding of engineering principles, in particular, related to the oil and gas sector. What I found valuable while working with Rito is the good commercial acumen he possesses, and importantly, a calm nature and clear mind while working under pressure. I would recommend Rito for a role where commercial decision making within a technical industry in a segment that is going through change needs a solid and reliable decision maker to drive results.

Kim Dumagco
Retail Territory Manager at Shell
January 26, 2018, Kim reported directly to Rito

I consider working with Sir Rex as an important part of my early years in the sales industry, particularly in the Petroleum. Sir Rex became one of my line managers in Mawab. He handled five talented sales individuals including me. Coming from different multinational companies including Total, he brought a lot of Global standards to a local company when it comes to work ethic, values, disciplines, and performance. Sir Rex was definitely not just an experienced Manager but an asset to Mawab back then. As a Boss, he was very passionate in delivering performance and growth not just to the company but to all of his subordinates as well. He has very good skills in managing and handling people. In fact, I consider him as a people person with high capacity of a strategic thinker. His coaching skills add up to his list of his managerial competencies. He goes well with millennial and I think that is an advantage. Another good quality of Sir Rex is that he is data driven. He knows how to analyze and present data to his team and translate it to workable plan. And most of the time, his decisions were based on insights derived from data. Sir Rex has the right attitude and mindset of a good Manager/Boss. He can bring out the best in you if let him coach you and help you. Working with him helped me acquire necessary skills which I consider as part of my current knowledge and ability right now. As a produce of Sir Rex, I am now working for the single-biggest branded petroleum company in the world as a Retail Territory Manager, and I would not be able to reach this point if I did not met Sir Rex and became his subordinate. I recommend him to companies needing a valuable asset because I know he possess high capacity, experience, and potential.
