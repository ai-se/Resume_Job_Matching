CAREER OBJECTIVES
I’m a qualified trade tested electrician seeking an opportunity to forge and further my career within the electrical engineering field. I would like to use my current skills and add value to any organization that is also looking at expanding the knowledge base it currently possesses. I prefer to work in a safe environment and according to the Ohs act and standards observed by the employer. My current skills include testing, maintenance and troubleshooting of: several types of single and three phase electric motors; variable speed drives; panel wiring including starters such as star/delta, sequence starters, forward and reverse; industrial and domestic electrical installations and components such as circuit breakers, plugs, lights; distribution box wiring, labeling.
I also have limited knowledge of plc installation and fault finding and UPS. Also, working on my wireman’s license, passed both paper 1&2 installation rules and the unit standards. Having had the experience working in the fmcg, I have learnt the importance of team work; resilience; paying attention to detail.
