QUALIFICATIONS

I’m a twenty year retired military veteran (1985-2005). I’ve excelled in my jobs, both in a military capacity and in the civilian sector. I have great people skills and enjoy the challenge of working with different people. I am able to manage up as well as down. I am a highly trained and a fully qualified mechanic and possess my HVAC EPA universal certificate. I am also excellent with maintaining all types of forms and records, employee time management and, contractor schedules and payment.
I received a Certificate as a Machinist. My duties included the fabrication, repair, and modification of metallic and non-metallic parts using grinders, milling machines, and power cutoff saws. I interpreted job orders, blueprints, sketches, and specifications.
I have received two qualification Certificates, one in UH-1 Helicopter Repair and one in Turbine Engine Repair. My knowledge of maintenance procedures is excellent and my ability to diagnose and troubleshoot all systems of the aircraft is second to none. I have carried this discipline over to the facilities and building maintenance sector.
I have experience with managing facilities Contractors, personnel and, parts and labor. I have relocated a business unit from the United States to Mexico and am currently in the process of decommissioning and closing a US factory in Versailles KY.
