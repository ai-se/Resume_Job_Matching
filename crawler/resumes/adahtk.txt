Professional Summary

Twenty years of experience in the computing field. Initially working as a Data Storage Administrator, I also ran backup-as-a-service and was an Installation Engineer and Analyst. I have worked as a contractor for most of my career. Lately I have been a consultant for large storage vendors. Most of my experience lies in traditional infrastructure protection and storage systems. However, my broad range of technical competencies and business acumens – along with the ability to simplify technical details into easily understood terminologies – allow me to bridge the gap between upper management and technology specialists.
I am currently seeking a role in technical infrastructure consulting or big data deployment.
