Dear Sir,
I have been doing computer and network infrastructure support for many years, primarily in the SMB marketplace. While my focus has been on the entire enterprise from a technical perspective, from an entrepreneurial perspective I know what needs to be done across the entire infrastructure ……which can now, seamlessly extend to and include the ‘cloud’. Please understand this…I can walk into a shell of a building and completely install and setup the entire network including all the servers…and be responsible for that organization! I have enough understanding and resources that I can fully support and\or relocate an entire office and put it anywhere on the planet it needs to be.
I’ve gotten pretty resourceful and I know what works and especially, products and services that are reliable. I can think on my feet and work under pressure! I would like to make the transition back into corporate IT and/or management and feel I have a lot of experience and intellect to offer, especially with all the experience I’ve gained I know what to watch out for. Since I do have a lot of firsthand experience, I know all the industry related nuances. Please give me a call either way. I have a very diverse background with a lot of experience in many areas including DFARS, NIST 800-171 and SCIF related standards. I can do what you’re asking for…and very likely, more! Look forward to meeting you.
Thanks,
Rick McClure
