Summary

I started out as a entry level machine operator, then advanced to a technical operator where I was responsible for change overs, and began troubleshooting issues with the machine. In 2011 I started my mechanics job. This included changing bad air cylinders, solenoid valves. Also would change out bad sensors. I can follow sensor inputs back to the PLC. Check for outputs to desired device. Some experience with vision systems, robots by the company called Epson. Have replaced conveyor belts and motors. I have operated CNC machines, turn centers and mill centers.
