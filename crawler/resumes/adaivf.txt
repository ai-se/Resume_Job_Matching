Abstract:
Solar panel Ideal conversion efficiency: 15%. The remaining energy is converted into heat and these heat increases the operating temperature of the solar panel system which effects the electrical power production of solar panel module. Damage of solar modules- shortening in life span and lower in conversion efficiency. A cooling system using paraffin wax as a PCM is used.
