“Hexagonal Fractal Antenna for Multiband Wireless Communications” (Aug 2015 – April 2016) In modern wireless communication systems and of other wireless applications, wider bandwidth, multiband and low profile antennas are in great demand for both commercial and military applications, and other advantages.
“Blind Equalization of bipolar 2-PAM and 4-QAM signals using NARX Neural system”
(July 2018 – July 2019)
When a signal is propagated through a communication channel then due to channel impairments, the received and the transmitted signal varies. The objective is to estimate the equalization filter, which is the inverse of the channel impulse response. In cases, where non-linear channel distortions are too excessive, neural network based equalizers can be used. The softwares used are MATLAB and SIMULINK respectively. SOFTWARES:
