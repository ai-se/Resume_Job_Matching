Title: “Secure Data Retrieval for Decentralized Disruption-Tolerant Military Networks”. Language: Java.
Team Size: 4.
Description:
we provide a multi authority CP-ABE scheme for secure data retrieval in decentralized DTNs. Each local authority issues partial personalized and attribute key components to a user by performing secure 2PC protocol with the central authority. Each attribute key of a user can be updated individually and immediately. Thus, the scalability and security can be enhanced in the proposed scheme.
Responsibilities:
Supported team members in project design and architecture. Developed the Attribute-based Encryption module.
Involved in project documentation
