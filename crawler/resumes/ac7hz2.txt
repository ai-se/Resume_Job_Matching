SUMMARY
I have been involved in the Construction Industry for my entire career starting out as a Carpenter and Mastered the trade early in life and became a Master Builder becoming a General Contractor at the age of 22 building both for myself and other companies. As my Profession evolved, I expended my fields to include: Pipefitting, Welding, Underwater deep sea welding, Certified Aviation Mechanic, Private and Commercial Pilot, Surveyor and a myriad of other related skills that gave me a perspective that few have had the opportunity to accomplish. I have exceptional people skills and unsurpassed entrepreneurial skills and have had the exposure of other cultures in 49 States and 17 Countries Due to my scope and range of experience. My exposure in working in a Global Community has given me appreciation and insight on how to solve diverse and complicated issues and taught me to think “Outside the Box” and articulate so many varied applications.

SKILLS
I am a “Results oriented individual” because I have had to achieve on a personal level, “On time results” as well as “Profitability” both as an employer and as an employee. I excel at getting the job done due to my “Hands on career” and have a grounded and innate ability and understanding of how and what it takes to complete a task at hand.
I don’t ask an individual to do the impossible. Only what is possible for me to accomplish.

I am a Master Builder, GC, Machinist, Underwater welder, Private and Commercial Pilot, Heavy equipment operator, Surveyor, Draftsman, Captain/Navigator and Published Novelist of Techno Fiction. These diverse fields of interest give me the unique ability to think ‘Way outside the proverbial box” as few might.
