With over 7 years of experience in the Field of IT, I am growing my skillset to be more client-centric as a Technology Veteran, focusing more on the business outcomes as against technology pieces, hence I am becoming more vendor agnostic just to ensure that business problems are solved with the right solution, centering more on the big picture that is “end-to-end” as against fragmentary. With this in mind, I stay ahead of those technology components that drive the right business outcomes and solutions. Hence, I possess strong technical skills with multinational work ethics. I also look forward to a mutually beneficial association with a group of dedicated people bound by a Common thread Strengths:
Networks, Security, Collaboration, Datacenter and Cloud Expert with strong skills in Presales, Presentation, HLD (high level design),LLD(low level design), implementation, migration and integration of networks, security and datacenter solutions. Strong focus on customer satisfaction and tenacity for excellence. Ability to learn continuously from both physical and virtual team. Strong wiliness to learn new things and to grow in the industry.
