PROJECTS
NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction 06/2019 - 09/2019
• Loaded 1.5 million taxi data on Google Cloud Platform and visualized the datasets by Folium map to facilitate data cleaning and feature engineering process.
• Generated new features: categorized pick-up and drop-off locations into 15 districts through K-means clustering; created categorical features based on pick-up datetimes.
• Incorporated additional features through National Weather Service and Open Source Routing Machine API.
• Eliminated outliers based on latitude and longitude, then selected critical features through PCA techniques.
• Built the trip duration prediction model with RMSLE of 0.213 by using LightGBM. Energy Prediction 03/2019 – 05/2019
• Retrieved the energy usage data from New York Independent System Operator and combined with the weather data from Dark Sky API to discover influential factors of the energy usage.
• Reorganized the weather datasets as five-minute time segmentation to match the energy usage datasets for generating date-time based features.
• Applied recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique to avoid overfitting and reduce the training time.
• Achieved 88% accuracy of the energy usage prediction based on a machine learning model, using random forests and linear regression algorithms. Quora Insincere Questions Classification 09/2018 - 12/2018
• Regularized Quora questions through removing non-representative words in Natural Language Toolkit, and then defined the keywords from the processed questions.
• Tokenized the above results into word vectors and applied neural language processing techniques to classify insincere questions.
• Built filters based on the user preference to further reduce irrelevant texts to improve the user experience. EXPERIENCE
Data Analyst Intern Industrial and Commercial Bank of China - Online i03/2019 - 06/2019
