You are a scrappy, hungry, versatile software engineer looking for an opportunity to make your mark on the world. You love systems programming and are looking to make impact at a fast pace. You are looking to get obsessed with building something that will make people\'s lives better. Not only do the terms ""enterprise,"" ""security,"" and ""developer tools"" mean something to you, they also represent areas where you want to make meaningful contributions.\nAbout the team. We are a stealth-mode company looking for a member of our founding team with nontrivial systems engineering experience. We have deep expertise in systems engineering, software analysis, and data privacy and are setting out to change how people work with data for the better. The technical sophistication of our offering will be a key differentiator, so we highly value good engineering!\nAbout Akita. As companies collect more data, it\'s increasingly important for their success to get a handle on how that data is being used. Changes in consumer data regulation have made it especially important to make sure that data is not getting written places it is not supposed to go.\nThese trends have given us the rare opportunity to build a new kind of data tool that gives a level of visibility and control over data that did not previously exist. By giving visibility to information not previously surfaced by any tool, Akita allows engineering, security, compliance, and devops teams to focus on using their data, rather than tracking it down and not losing it. Our approach is based on a decade of research by founder and CEO Jean Yang\'s research at CMU and MIT.\nWe are a seed-stage company with the backing of two of the best VC firms in enterprise software, as well as a small number of incredible angel investors and advisors with deep experience in building companies and products.
