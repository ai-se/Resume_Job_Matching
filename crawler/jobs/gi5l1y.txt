Job Title = Technician

We're MasTec Advanced Technologies and we're looking for Installation Techs to install, service and upgrade entertainment systems. This is a great opportunity to put your experience in computers, electrical, maintenance, cable, military and customer service to work for a great company.

In this role, sometimes you're the 'make it happen' tech who gets families and businesses up and running with all the TV they love. Some days you're the 'save the day' tech, fixing the system if things go wrong and bringing the TV back (this is especially critical on game days or season finales). And on other days, you're the 'rainmaker' tech, upgrading customers' systems to maximize their entertainment experience. Seriously, you're pretty much a hero.

At MasTec, our most successful Installation Techs have these four things in common:

They are customer service-driven:

* They are friendly, approachable and comfortable meeting new people and can talk to just about anyone

* They have solid communication skills

* They are "likeable experts" who deliver a good service experience for customers

They are hands-on:

* They enjoy the variety of assignments from site surveys to equipment installation to troubleshooting

* Ladders and power tools are their version of a desk and office supplies

* They're resourceful multi-taskers and problem solvers who will do what it takes to troubleshoot issues (this is where the 'save the day' part comes in)

They are tech-savvy:

* They have the know-how and persistence to troubleshoot technical system issues

* They like to learn new technologies

* They'll ensure a quality connection

* They know their way around a smart phone

They are self-motivated:

* They like making multiple customer visits per day because they're motivated by the pay-per-job model control your own pay

* They're at their best when working on their own and setting their own schedule

* They represent our client and MasTec with integrity, professionalism and friendly service

Does this sound like you? If so, we invite you to apply to MasTec today. Here, we work hard to set you up for success. Here's what's in store for you at MasTec:

* Competitive wages

* High-quality tools to get you started

* Uniform, van and gas card

* Full medical, dental and vision benefits

* 401(k) with a company match that's 100% vested (that's free money)
