Job Title = Senior Database Engineer

Were looking for humble, but ambitious, razor-sharp Database Engineer who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you know how to design a solid database schema and have a long experience owning databases that can never go down in AWS RDS. You know who to create reliable infrastructure in AWS to make sure the database is always up and running but also know how to create a backup and DR strategy and use it in the extreme case that failure happens.

Why We Need This Role
We are designing our central DB from the ground-up in AWS RDS and planning ETL jobs to bring in the data dispersed in multiple databases created by separate teams within the organization. We rely on this role to design the new schema, specify the ETL processes, and execute them in a way that does not interrupt the live applications. You are also expected to design the new database infrastructure based on AWS RDS in a way that guarantees it will almost never go down while creating a backup and DR plan to bring the database back up in the rare case that failure happens.

Why You Should Join
This is a challenging and diverse role that requires you to build both, an organization and new generation of Builder product, nearly from the ground up. Only join this role if you are craving rapid growth, able to create a path in unchartered territory, and comfortable with trying, failing and course-correcting fast.
