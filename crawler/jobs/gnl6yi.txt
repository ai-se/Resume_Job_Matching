Job Title = Engineer

Our story
Just like our doors, our minds are open too. Ever since we opened our first hotel, The Hoxton Shoreditch, way back in 2006, weve never justbeen about offering a bed for the night. We want to be more than that, providing a place where guests can hang out alongside the locals and submerse themselves in the neighborhood with vibrant, welcoming public spaces.Then there's our eclectic program of monthly events where we bring the outside in, workingwith local creatives to curate events unique to each location.
Back in 2006, The Hoxton, Shoreditch in East London changed the hotel model, proving style didnt need to be sacrificed for value and that honest pricing is still very much at the heart of everything we do. We opened our second hotel, The Hoxton, Holborn in 2014, followed by properties in Amsterdam, Paris, Williamsburg, Portland, and Chicago. Los Angeles and Southwark are all coming soon. While each hotel has its own character, no matter where we open you can be sure to find the familiar Hoxton Hustle.
Each Hoxton hotel is individual, incorporating the uniqueness of their neighborhoods using local designers, artists, and illustrators for everything from interiors to wallpaper, art and neighborhood guides. The Hoxton, Williamsburg is on the original site of the Rosenwach factory, the maker of the iconic wooden water towers dotted along the skyline of New York City. Featuring 175 bedrooms, a vibrant public area, restaurant, terrace bar, and rooftopalong with The Apartment, our events and meeting space.
