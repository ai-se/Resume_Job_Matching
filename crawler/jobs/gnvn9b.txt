* To work with animals, including regular husbandry and welfare checks.
* To work in collaboration with researchers at ZSL, Imperial College and with UK and international collaborators.
* To maintain accurate and complete records of all findings.
* To learn new skills and contribute to other projects.
* To undertake fieldwork as appropriate.
Person Specification: The successful candidate will ideally have: * Proven relevant experience in amplicon, PacBio long-read and shotgun sequencing, also RNAseq.
