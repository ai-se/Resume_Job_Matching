In 1967, the Pacific Northwest was without a Toyota forklift dealership, so Holman Distribution Center owners, Herbert & Leonard Clark, began their own dealership in Portland, Oregon: CB Toyota Lift.
Though our business has changed from the family-owned Clark business to Toyota Tsusho ownership, we have still maintained the same family environment.
Of our 100+ members, many of them have been here for over a decade and some as long as 25 years.
We deliver on what others promise.
