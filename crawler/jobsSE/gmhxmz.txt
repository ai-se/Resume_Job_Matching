DescriptionWe're looking for humble, but ambitious, razor-sharp engineering leader who can teach us a thing or two.
We promise to return the favor.
Like us, you take product development, API, Analytics and ML or AI platform engineering seriously; you're passionate about technology and, even more so, about leadership.
We embrace those who see things differently, aren't afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints.
That's where you come in.
We are currently seeking an engineering Technical Lead to drive technical vision and execution as well as provide architectural and functional leadership to a team of engineers in an innovative and fast paced environment.
Our selection process will emphasize software engineering and architecture skills as well as SDLC or scrum process organizational skills equally.
The ideal candidate must be a master of the engineering domain and be able to contribute as an individual contributor (software engineer and architect) at least half of the time.
We are looking for someone who is equally comfortable leading by influence or authority.
Last, we are looking for a rare mix of intelligence, integrity, domain knowledge, verbal agility, and diplomacy which allows you to rapidly earn the trust of technically astute engineers and product astute product managers.
Why We Need This Role We are looking for a leader to help us build out a set of AI/ML powered tools and services which will allow us to automatically optimize client cloud infrastructure by detecting underutilized/unutilized resources, reprovision on the fly, and better predict spend patterns.
This includes, but is not limited to, creating a modular and robust platform that can integrate with multiple cloud providers such as AWS, Digital Ocean, Azure, etc.
and Why You Should Join This is a challenging and diverse role that requires you to build both, an organization and new generation of our product, CloudOps, nearly from the ground up.
Only join this role if you are craving rapid growth, able to create a path in uncharted territory, and comfortable with trying, failing and course-correcting fast.
