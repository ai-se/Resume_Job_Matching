The Opportunity
Do you want to take part in changing the world by giving scientists instant access to innovative research? By connecting the right people to work on breakthrough discoveries? All while working from home or traveling the world?
We are looking for an engaging and charismatic presenter, who inspires others about technology, is motivated by helping clients succeed, and values the unprecedented lifestyle the Internet enables.
As a Product Evangelist, our customers and the ATIV team will look to you for thought-leadership, market insight, and technical expertise about our product. You will dazzle your audience with compelling stories that bring our product s benefits to life while acting as a knowledgeable and reliable technical advisor to clients and potential customers. You will ensure client success by finding the right solutions for their needs, and complete the feedback loop by bringing market intelligence back to the ATIV team.
This is a position for someone who has a passion for learning, loves mobile technology, continuously exceeds expectations, and enjoys sharing their knowledge with others. Mediocre should be a term that makes you queasy and the unknown should drive you towards discovery rather than making you nervous.
