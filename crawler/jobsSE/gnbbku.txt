Job Title = Dynamics NAV - Senior Solution Engineer

Our Culture:
Stoneridge Software began with an idea: How can Microsoft implementations be done better? After considering the idea for some time, Eric Newell created Stoneridge Software, which has quickly flourished into a tenacious Microsoft Gold Partner. As a member of Microsoft's Inner Circle, we know how to work hard, but we also know how important it is to balance work with family and the rest of our lives. In order to achieve that work-life balance, we provide unlimited vacation, paid parental leave and even beer on-tap in our offices.
