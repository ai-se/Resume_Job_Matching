WHAT YOU LL BE DOING

The small and effective Server Cloud team successfully ported our popular Tableau Server product to Linux, making it Linux-native and delighting our customers. Building on that success, our teamnow focuses on two areas: continuing to improve the Linux experience for customers using Server in their organization, and containerizing Tableau Server using Docker and Kubernetes to enable autoscaling and blue/green deployments.

We are a multicultural team that welcomes diversity and works closely with one another, supporting each other through code reviews, shared debugging sessions, and mentorship. Through the Server on Linux beta testing process, we have worked extensively with customers to ensure the product meets their needs.

We work with a variety of languages throughout Tableau Server, including Java, C++, Bash scripts, JavaScript, and more. We have a strong concentration on Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and increasingly work in the public cloud, especially AWS.

* Lead the design and implementation of new features,

* Develop deep domain knowledge and teach others what you know,
