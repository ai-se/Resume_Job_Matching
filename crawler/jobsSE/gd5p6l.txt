Were looking for humble, but ambitious, razor-sharp technical lead who can teach us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take product development, API, Analytics and ML or AI platform engineering seriously; youre passionate about technology and, even more so, about leadership. We embrace those who see things differently, arent afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for constraints. Thats where you come in. We are currently seeking an engineering Technical Lead to drive technical vision and execution as well as provide architectural and functional leadership to a team of engineers in an innovative and fast paced environment. Our selection process will emphasize software engineering and architecture skills as well as SDLC or scrum process organizational skills equally. The ideal candidate must be a master of the engineering domain and be able to contribute as an individual contributor (software engineer and architect) at least half of the time. We are looking for someone who is equally comfortable leading by influence or authority. Last, we are looking for a rare mix of intelligence, integrity, domain knowledge, verbal agility, and diplomacy which allows you to rapidly earn the trust of technically astute engineers and product astute product managers.

Why We Need This Role
We are looking for a leader to help us build out a set of AI powered tools and services which will allow us to pro-grammatically assemble licensed client applications from the building blocks of code. This includes, but not limited to, developing ESB technology that will serve as assembly foundation for said assemblies to programmatic orchestration of underpinning infrastructure. We want to do this to disrupt and automate software development in a similar fashion Henry Fords assembly lines disrupted and automated car manufacturing.

Why You Should Join
This is a challenging and diverse role that requires you to build both, an organization and new generation of Builder Assembly product, nearly from the ground up.
