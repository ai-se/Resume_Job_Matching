In addition to the individual applications you will be helping to craft our shared open and closed source libraries used across our infrastructure.

Requirements:

* Creatively solve business challenges using Rails and React

* Confidently build Rails API interfaces that are scalable, easy to document, and fun to use.

* Conceptualize and create simple solutions when adapting our product to new integrations

* Carefully manage both document and sql data stores, handling large amounts of customer data

* Deliver high-quality, scalable Javascript and SCSS.

* Work closely with product and design teams to design simple, powerful, innovative user experiences (web and mobile)

* Continuously improve your team's productivity through automation and process improvement

* Future-proof your work through a combination of thoughtful monitoring, automated testing, refactoring, and modularization.

* Lead by example in the area of code review and architecture

* Mentoring and teaching others on the team through pairing

About You

* Expertise in either Rails or React and Redux

* You have at least five years of professional experience building applications.

* You care about the details and take ownership over what you're involved in.
