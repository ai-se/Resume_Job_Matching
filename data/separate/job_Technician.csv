In 1967, the Pacific Northwest was without a Toyota forklift dealership, so Holman Distribution Center owners, Herbert & Leonard Clark, began their own dealership in Portland, Oregon: CB Toyota Lift.
Though our business has changed from the family-owned Clark business to Toyota Tsusho ownership, we have still maintained the same family environment.
Of our 100+ members, many of them have been here for over a decade and some as long as 25 years.
We deliver on what others promise.

* They like to learn new technologies
* They'll ensure a quality connection
* They know their way around a smart phone

* They have the know-how and persistence to troubleshoot technical system issues
* They like to learn new technologies
* They'll ensure a quality connection
* They know their way around a smart phone

You'll coordinate schedules with customers, review their order and begin the installation. Once the system is installed, you'll give customers a tour of their system to make the most of their new or upgraded service.

In this role, sometimes you're the 'make it happen' tech who gets families and businesses up and running with all the TV they love.

They are tech-savvy:

* They have the know-how and persistence to troubleshoot technical system issues

* They like to learn new technologies

* They'll ensure a quality connection

* They know their way around a smart phone

They are self-motivated:

* They like making multiple customer visits per day because they're motivated by the pay-per-job model control your own pay

* They're at their best when working on their own and setting their own schedule

* They represent our client and MasTec with integrity, professionalism and friendly service
