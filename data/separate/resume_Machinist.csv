To whom it may concern;
I am currently the Maintenance Manager for an automotive supplier. My duties also include doing all the PLC programming (all Allen Bradley RsLogix 500 and 5000), HMI programming (Allen Bradley), and Fanuc robot programming/troubleshooting as well as electrical upgrades/installation and troubleshooting.
During my career I have implemented ideas to improve machine uptime and scheduled downtime with the management group to do pm’s and repairs to reduce overtime as well as have worked with vendors to reduce cost. I have made items common between all our machines to reduce the amount of inventory needed in our crib therefore reducing out overhead costs.
I have traveled to some of other facilities to assist them with issues that they have been having using some of our improvements and lessons learned.
Have worked hand in hand with MIOSHA on our lockout tagout procedure and among other safety improvements in our plant. We have gone from having numerous findings to them wanting to issue us an award for our safety.
I have been in charge of numerous equipment and line installs. I take pride in the fact that we can do most in house without hiring outside contractors. From the machine setup to the utilities installation to the work flow and tuning in parts for cmm layout.
I got my start in this industry about 30 years ago. I started out as a machinist and moved to programming CNC mills and lathes. I then moved on to machine tool building and electrical work. I am strongly motivated and am hungry to learn new things.

Thank you for your time

PROJECTS:

6TH SEMESTER:

ECO-FRIENDLY WELDING BY HYDROGEN FUEL CELL:
Mostly all the countries are doing research in the development of renewable sources of energy to replace the fossil fuel as it is lacking day by day . So there in this project paper we are going to discuss about the use of hydrogen fuel cell for effective welding torch. As most of the welding is done either by the gas or by electricity directly. This paper shows the use of an electrolysis process in which water splits into hydrogen & oxgyen when electricity is supplied to it, which is further used as a flame for welding.

8TH SEMSETER:

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF DIESEL ENGINE WITH THE ADDITION OF HYDROGEN:
The environmental pollution particularly the air pollution plays an major role in global warming. The unburnt hydrocarbon(HC),carbon monoxide(CO),nitrogen oxides (NOX),sulphur oxides (SO2) etc.. present in the vehicle emission plays a major role in air pollution. In this project we fabricated a hydrogen dry cell to produce HHO gas of 6 liters per minute. The HHO gas is supplied to engine through the air in-take manifold. The HHO gas is well mixed with diesel after compression stroke. Now in combustion,the HHO gas is used to burn the HYDROCARBON effectively so the more power can be created from diesel molecules. And the pollution like unburnt hydrocarbon,others can be reduced . The performance and emmission test are conducted.

951-***-****
I am a well experienced Manufacturing and Design Engineer. I've been in the commercial, Industrial, Government, Private and Public industries. Products related to Consumer products such as high-volume Household shower, bath products, computer related market, and the Defense Government products. I've lead teams of engineers, technicians, assemblers, ""go-fer employees and supervised production lines. Also worked as a Manufacturing Engineer, non-supervisory roles, I’m a hands on type. I have also designed manufacturing assembly lines for low volume to high volume products. Each has involved robotics down to basic assembly tools. What I have most enjoyed is being able to work with different people to reach the goal of successful projects. Either as Project Engineer, Manufacturing Engineer, or Working with other Engineering/nonEngineering groups. I've worked simple low-cost budgets to million-dollar budgets. I'm not the type for high profile for attention. Rather the merits I have received have been very successful projects. And profitable. I attribute the success not to ""my wonderful"" brains and abilities, but rather to incorporate my talents to enable the people I work with to perform. I will admit that many times, the engineers I have managed were 'smarter' and more talented than myself. What my role is to allow those individuals to accomplish the success with my help. No egos involved. And in each project, been able to keep my team working well together. Of course, always some headaches, but been good outcomes.
My most prized memories are the successful projects. But along with it, has been being humbled many times by several individuals requesting to be on my projects. So, I bring the experience in Manufacturing, R&D, Design, Project Management. I truly enjoy the environment and the individuals. From the technical teams to the hands-on assemblers. I'm a hands-on type engineer.
Please consider this introduction letter and I will supply my resume history and references. Some names of businesses have been General Dynamics, Charleton Associates (later Xidex) an early Dysan funded computer product company, Seagate, Medical Devices companies, Consumer products, and most recent, Teledyne Instruments, and Real Sensors Inc.. -a company involved with Homeland Security protection at Airports- a variety of businesses. I myself worked Mills and Lathes, and other equipment in the shop. But I am Not a machinist. Leave that to the guys who are. I recommend and survey vendors for company needs. Have brought in many vendors to places of employment. This is a brief history what I can do. I am available to relocate, temporary or permanent.

Achievements

SAP R3 Implementation
In 1999 selected as team member and superuser for SAP R3 implementation at Anglo Platinum's Mogalakwena section .Largest open pit mine in Southern hemisphere. Implementation done by Gateway Project Implementation. Team consisted of 7 members and my role was to create project plan to populate all master data, ie Functioinal location structure, Equipment, Componants, Sub components, Maintenance packages, Maintenance plans, bill of materials, Measuring points, Resources, Task durations, Measuring documents, Rotable controls and Parts pick lists.
All statutory and legal inspections, tests like earth leakage, pressure vessel tests, brake tests, slope stability, Transformer tests etc.
Making use of historical data and full FMECA and RCM on fleet off 140 units of different equipment types from 300Ton dump trucks to Light delivery vehicles and Facilities. And on concentrator/process plant the process was duplicated but on fixed equipment like Ball mills, Cone crushers, Conveyors, compressors, Pressure vessels etc.
Responsible for testing complete cycle on each equipment type to ensure system functions to standard before roll out. The complete system implementation was completed in record time of 4 months.

Profit improvement program

In 2005 I called for a profit improvement program on Caterpillar dump trucks, The engines on these 280 ton truck were designed to last 18000 hours and we only managed between 8000 to 11000 hours before failure. These failures could not be explained by support personnel from CAT on site. I lead the team of 6 delegates including product support, parts management and maintenance specialists from CAT.
I crafted the project in collaboration with Growthcon Itl . The project lasted only 1 month and the final conclusion was turbo manufold gaskets were inferior and new spec was not communicated through STI's from CAT (Barloworld equipment) and old spec part numbers were never superseeded thus we used inferior parts for years. All engines were retro fitted with new spec parts and the project had a cost saving in access of R 30 000 000,00.

SAP R3 and Data mine interphase

In 2007 I initiated an project to interphase Data mine information to be automatically be included on measuring documents of equipment maintenance plans to eliminate input errors. The team consisted of 9 members from Mine, Data mine and SAP consultants. My role was as project leader.
The end product was in the form of Phat files being created on Data mine system that populates SAP PM twice daily by means of existing network connection.+
The whole project lasted 14 months as major drawbacks were experienced in terms of patent and licencing agreements but was duly resolved by involving Legal teams of both software providers.

Subject: Experienced Maintenance Manager

I am looking for a maintenance management position where I can put my management skills and mechanical knowledge to work. I have a proven safety and uptime performance record and welcome a challenge. I understand the value in teamwork and support team development. I started and ran my own contract maintenance business. My customers continually made offers to me to manage their maintenance departments. I accepted a position and therefore closed my business. During the first year as maintenance manager, the plant increased production from an average of 50,000BF a day to an average of 110,000BF a day. The mill is now one of the most productive and efficient sawmills on the east coast. The maintenance department supported the mill improvements with zero recordable accidents. Currently, I am the maintenance supervisor at Arauco Panels in Moncure, NC. Since joining the team, I have helped them to improve the finishing uptime by 20%. What use to be a bottle neck is now a dependable process that could handle 10 to 20% more throughput. I have been commuting to Moncure from my home in Virginia for the past 5 years. I think my long track record of dedication and ability to improve safety, equipment uptime and reliability speak for themselves. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Kevin Bass

Lean Project Coordinator
Watervliet Arsenal
Watervliet, NY 12089
Additional duties as a Lean Project coordinator were assigned to my primary supervisory position. Specific component lines were targeted to be developed into a lean manufacturing line and a “Lean Pull” manufacturing system, based on the concepts originally implemented by the Toyota Production System (TPS), which have been a benchmark of business quality, efficiency, profitability, and growth.
With the support of the process planner, and reporting directly to the Chief of Manufacturing, this position was tasked with training and leading a team of machinists in analyzing manufacturing lines, identifying wasteful elements, reconfiguration of processes, development of standard work, overall process improvement, and cross-training of staff. All this resulted in an increase of daily part flow of 350%.
The team of machinists was trained and supervised in documenting the details of each operation and recording it in a set of “Work Instructions” that became a baseline tool for all subsequent training on each operation.

6/4/12-3/17/13
LMP I2 Site Representative
Watervliet Arsenal
Watervliet, NY 12089
As a supervisor, I was on loan to the Business Transformation Office as a site rep for the LMP increment 2, Shop Floor Automation integration, representing the Watervliet Arsenal’s (WVA) Manufacturing Directorate, to the Army’s Industrial base. There were 17 Army sites represented in this Enterprise Solution.
The skills requirement for this assignment, were to have a broad based background in all of the WVA’s manufacturing processes to align the Increment 2 software, with our business requirements. The areas included shop floor manufacturing, labor transactions, quality documentation, material genealogy, metrology, Bills of Materials, process routings, supply functions, document revision history, final inspection reporting, and the associated workflow each of these elements must go through to produce product at the Watervliet Arsenal (WVA).
While on Temporary Duty (TDY), this position represented WVA, by attending Rapid Design Workshops (RDW) at the following installations, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi TX; Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville AL; Anniston Army Depot, Anniston AL; and Computer Sciences Corporation Marlton NJ over a duration of 9 months. Specific Subject Matter Experts (SME) from various departments at WVA were Identified to provide a deeper knowledge of each subject area. They were added to the team and sent with me on TDY to provide detailed knowledge of business processes and practices, for periods that their expertise was needed.
As variances between the software and our business requirements arose, (Gaps) I formulated positions on the impact it would have against WVA, by defining alternatives, their associated impact on cost, quality, mission capability, and human resources. All the sites voted on each Gap alternative and how it would affect the whole of the Army’s Industrial Base. The Gaps that were most critical to WVA were presented to Army Material Command (AMC) senior leadership for their determination of which alternative to use in the final software configuration design.

SUMMARY
I have been involved in the Construction Industry for my entire career starting out as a Carpenter and Mastered the trade early in life and became a Master Builder becoming a General Contractor at the age of 22 building both for myself and other companies. As my Profession evolved, I expended my fields to include: Pipefitting, Welding, Underwater deep sea welding, Certified Aviation Mechanic, Private and Commercial Pilot, Surveyor and a myriad of other related skills that gave me a perspective that few have had the opportunity to accomplish.

I don’t ask an individual to do the impossible. Only what is possible for me to accomplish.

I am a Master Builder, GC, Machinist, Underwater welder, Private and Commercial Pilot, Heavy equipment operator, Surveyor, Draftsman, Captain/Navigator and Published Novelist of Techno Fiction.
