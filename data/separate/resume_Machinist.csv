So there in this project paper we are going to discuss about the use of hydrogen fuel cell for effective welding torch. As most of the welding is done either by the gas or by electricity directly. This paper shows the use of an electrolysis process in which water splits into hydrogen & oxgyen when electricity is supplied to it, which is further used as a flame for welding.\n\n8TH SEMSETER:\n\nPERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF DIESEL ENGINE WITH THE ADDITION OF HYDROGEN:\nThe environmental pollution particularly the air pollution plays an major role in global warming. The unburnt hydrocarbon(HC),carbon monoxide(CO),nitrogen oxides (NOX),sulphur oxides (SO2) etc.. present in the vehicle emission plays a major role in air pollution. In this project we fabricated a hydrogen dry cell to produce HHO gas of 6 liters per minute. The HHO gas is supplied to engine through the air in-take manifold. The HHO gas is well mixed with diesel after compression stroke. Now in combustion,the HHO gas is used to burn the HYDROCARBON effectively so the more power can be created from diesel molecules. And the pollution like unburnt hydrocarbon,others can be reduced .

The complete system implementation was completed in record time of 4 months.\n\nProfit improvement program\n\nIn 2005 I called for a profit improvement program on Caterpillar dump trucks, The engines on these 280 ton truck were designed to last 18000 hours and we only managed between 8000 to 11000 hours before failure. These failures could not be explained by support personnel from CAT on site. I lead the team of 6 delegates including product support, parts management and maintenance specialists from CAT.\nI crafted the project in collaboration with Growthcon Itl . The project lasted only 1 month and the final conclusion was turbo manufold gaskets were inferior and new spec was not communicated through STI's from CAT (Barloworld equipment) and old spec part numbers were never superseeded thus we used inferior parts for years. All engines were retro fitted with new spec parts and the project had a cost saving in access of R 30 000 000,00.\n\nSAP R3 and Data mine interphase\n\nIn 2007 I initiated an project to interphase Data mine information to be automatically be included on measuring documents of equipment maintenance plans to eliminate input errors.

I have a proven safety and uptime performance record and welcome a challenge. I understand the value in teamwork and support team development. I started and ran my own contract maintenance business. My customers continually made offers to me to manage their maintenance departments. I accepted a position and therefore closed my business. During the first year as maintenance manager, the plant increased production from an average of 50,000BF a day to an average of 110,000BF a day. The mill is now one of the most productive and efficient sawmills on the east coast. The maintenance department supported the mill improvements with zero recordable accidents. Currently, I am the maintenance supervisor at Arauco Panels in Moncure, NC. Since joining the team, I have helped them to improve the finishing uptime by 20%. What use to be a bottle neck is now a dependable process that could handle 10 to 20% more throughput. I have been commuting to Moncure from my home in Virginia for the past 5 years. I think my long track record of dedication and ability to improve safety, equipment uptime and reliability speak for themselves.

I am in charge of installing all new equipment and maintaining or updating the old. I write and issue work orders for the maintenance staff using SAP. I am also responsible for writing Safe Standard Operating Procedures (SSOP's) and creating a preventive maintenance (PM) schedule for the department. I use CAD to draw blueprints for projects, new equipment and designs.\n\nMaintenance Manager for Morgan Lumber Red Oak, VA June 2008 to June 2011\nI managed day and night shift maintenance.

I also managed the parts department. I built and installed new machines. I am experienced in hydraulic systems maintenance and troubleshooting. I set up wood optimizers to get max yield and accuracy. I also set up and aligned band saw machines. I helped to improve from lumber production from 40,000 BF to 120,000 BF a day.\n\nOwner and Manager of Bass Machine and Welding May 2003 to June 2008\nI started and ran the company. I had up to five people working for me at any given time. We built new equipment, did complete equipment installation projects and supported manufacturing plants with shut down maintenance work.

They were added to the team and sent with me on TDY to provide detailed knowledge of business processes and practices, for periods that their expertise was needed.\nAs variances between the software and our business requirements arose, (Gaps) I formulated positions on the impact it would have against WVA, by defining alternatives, their associated impact on cost, quality, mission capability, and human resources. All the sites voted on each Gap alternative and how it would affect the whole of the Army\xe2\x80\x99s Industrial Base.
