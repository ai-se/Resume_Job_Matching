It regresses two distinct and different fields of science to common scientific methodology logic, structure, and tracks. Then it synthesizes and mirrors their development into a novel interdisciplinary study.\nI am interested in furthering the horizontal and vertical development of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sociology of Software Architecture.\xe2\x80\x9d Specific areas of focus are: sociology of search, data science, artificial intelligence, social networking, education technology, and fintech. SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE / DATA SCIENCE / ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY:\nResearch and development, pioneering applications, team leadership, mentor, teacher, trainer, consultant, advisor, strategist, market vision/mission dev, executive management, board member, partnership, entrepreneurship, speaking, promoting, and publishing. Bio\nI am a lifelong academic and software development entrepreneur. In 1995, I advanced to Ph.D. candidacy at UCI (University of California, Irvine). My research was focused on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sociology of Technology: The PC Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d Soonafter, I jumped into the internet revolution. I spent 25+ years working on internet related software technology startups. I always approached software architecture development with a strong sociological methods/requirements perspective. As a result of my extensive research and development, and real market experience and application, I pioneered a novel interdisciplinary study methodology, namely \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sociology of Software Architecture. \xe2\x80\x9c\nI started my passionate involvement in software development and related technology with the PC Revolution in the mid 1980ies. My early applications were in database marketing, a precursor to data science. I applied powerful, emerging, and advanced statistical modeling to direct response marketing and achieved great results. My next big project was in education technology. My third big project was in local search (CEO of eLocal Network). My latest project was a fintech/data science startup. In 2013, I was granted patent #8489480. I had two other important and innovative patent applications in local search and data anonymity. I returned to academia part time with a Direct Ph.D. at UEL program to develop and publish my research. I just completed a 350 pages Ph.D. thesis/book titled ""The Evolution of Sociology of Software Architecture."" Publishing of this thesis/book is TBA. My goal is to lead a transformation of the software Page 2 of 6\narchitecture development practice. More research and development in this and related fields of study are in progress.\nEducation\n2013-2019 Ph.D., School of Architecture, Computing and Engineering, UEL, London Research: Sociology of Software Architecture, Software Architecture Development Optimization 1990-1995 Ph.D. Candidate, School of Social Sciences, Comparative American Culture, UCI Research: Sociology of Technology: The PC Revolution 1987-1989 M.A., Comparative American Culture, UC, Irvine 1979-1985 B.A., Economics, University of California, Irvine Activities and Societies\nThe Enterprise Computing (EC) Research Group\nAcademic Work Experience\n1987-1995 Teacher Assistant in the social sciences at the University of California, Irvine Entrepreneurial Experience\nI started my career in academia and direct and database marketing (a precursor to data science). I applied advanced academic social segmentation statistical and data approaches, models, and techniques to invent and innovate direct marketing targeting and response engagement. My next big three projects were in internet development. This included: education technology, local search, fintech, and their data science components. Furthermore, I have been involved in leading several other startup software development teams and projects. My academic R&D continued with every project. I looked at software architecture and development from a sociological requirements perspective. In addition to one patent (#8489480) and two other innovative patent applications, my academic/career development culminated in my Ph.D. in \xe2\x80\x9cArchitecture, Page 3 of 6\nComputing, and Engineering\xe2\x80\x9d degree with the UEL.

The method restructures debt by transferring ownership of defined debt packages from debt holders to third-party debt buyers who function as financial bridges between the debtors and the debt holders. The method accelerates the debt resolution process by executing the debt-restructure agreement early in the debt resolution period, thereby eliminating the need for the debtor to accumulate debt settlement funds in an escrow fund prior to the initiation of settlement negotiations (as is the case in debt settlement), and erasing delinquent debt as soon as the debt-restructure agreement is executed. The method is designed and adapted to execution on a computer network system.

The method and system involve creation of an anonymous debt database such that non-parties to the debt may comply with regulations regarding maintaining confidentiality of debtor information. The anonymous debt database may be made available to be searched by a debtor using one or more anonymous search Page 5 of 6\nparameters to identify any debt in the database that is associated with the debtor.

I am currently upgrading to the advanced web-based Project Management tool by SmartSheet, for its superior support of multiple projects, the development of both software (Agile support) and hardware infrastructure, and the updating of project workers & stakeholders anywhere. Projects are normally delivered on time and in compliance with regulations.\n2.In Cybersecurity I have architected best & proprietary solutions in Enterprise Identity and Privileged Access Management (IAM & PAM) that stops data breaches and unauthorized infrastructure access, by Enterprise Teleworkers, Outside Contractors and Insiders, as they are attempted. CAC cards and keyed passwords are for the history books, while I do not limit personal liberties. Keys to success is in the combined usage of continuous multifactor biometrics and behavioral analytics.\n3.In Telecommunications I have engineered numerous LAN and WAN networks and systems in the most cost effective, efficient and reliable manner to best support an organization\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.\n4.My project management contributions usually lead to lower costs, faster problem resolution, higher reliability and availability. Much of this is attributable to my significant and diverse knowledge and experiences which best allow me to anticipate problems before they occur, that can interrupt project tasks, make for missed milestones, and thereby creating additional and unexpected costs.\n5.I am excellent when it comes to training others so that they can carry on after my project is completed. As a project, online or in person, I have also trained others in my core competencies.\n6.I am exceptionally healthy, physically & intellectually fit, and passionate about the work I do. I look forward to a face to face interview to prove this.\n7.Lastly, I am forever a student, always investigating new technologies and products, to seek better solutions for client\xe2\x80\x99s problems and desired improvements.\n\nEMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS (6), CONSULTING PROJECTS (25), & EXPERT WITNESS (15) LITIGATIONS\n4/1/2009 to current \xe2\x80\x93 Managing Director (Owner), Sr. Consultant & Project Manager - The Technology Consultancy\nAfter returning to the U.S. from my employment contract with Third Wave International NV, in 2009, I restarted my independent consulting practice, conducting projects in Cybersecurity, Distance Learning, Surveillance and building telecom networks. This practice remained operationally while I started and developed CSR-Support LLC. In-fact the revenues generated from consulting clients starting in 2009 was exclusively used to fund CSR-Support\xe2\x80\x99s operations. Between 1995 and 2009 most of the work I did was under Employment contracts. Other recent technology projects were for: FCC (2009) \xe2\x80\x93 Louisiana Rural Health Care Network; Big Star Media Group (2011) Developed a solution to optimally stream live music from the Ground Zero Blues Club around the world, and the feasibility of a CLEC for Coahoma County, Mississippi: Jena Industries (2012 \xe2\x80\x93 2015) Designed a call center in Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Nigeria and a microwave systems linking it to an expected ocean fiber landing: APT College (2016-17) Training technicians to obtain a FCC General Radiotelephone Operators license; and continuously provided Expert Witness testimony (15+cases) regarding IT technologies, Shareholder interests, Fraud, Patent infringements, Contracts, and Murder. Earlier consulting projects included: Dreyfus Corporation (Mellon Bank) \xe2\x80\x93 advanced brokerage call processing & routing systems for 40 locations around the world; VITELCOM \xe2\x80\x93 consulting services for Chase Manhattan Bank for faster check clearing, State Farm Ins.- network configuration, NYC Housing Authority - hundreds of switching systems, and wireless communications for HQ, Police and Emergency services, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.- Fiber Optic Ring network, John Hancock Life Insurance Co \xe2\x80\x93 network configurations design and implementation, State Street Bank & Trust Co \xe2\x80\x93 switching system for offshore site, British Airways \xe2\x80\x93 ground control radio system, The Equitable Insurance Company \xe2\x80\x93 network configuration and billing verification, Palmas Del Mar \xe2\x80\x93 switching and outside plant, AT&T \xe2\x80\x93 independent consulting strategy for 5 years to Board Chairman, Parsons & Whittemore \xe2\x80\x93 large PBXs, network designs and wireless systems US & CA, General Motors \xe2\x80\x93 voice and data management strategy, Citibank, N.A.- telecom management training, Warner-Amex \xe2\x80\x93 satellite communications, Bear Sterns \xe2\x80\x93 network interfaces. United Illuminating \xe2\x80\x93 Phone Systems and Networks.\n\nBe advised that the times I worked on Employment Contracts, Consulting Agreements & Expert Witness Projects for The Technology Consultancy, may leave time gaps. During these gaps I am working for my consulting company to find and secure my next Employment, Consulting or Expert Witness activity. Secondly, the times I work on these activities may also overlap.\n\n7/13/2012 \xe2\x80\x93 11/11/2017 - Chief Executive Officer - CSR-Support LLC, Alpharetta, GA - SDVOSB\nI created this company with the intent to establish a customer service, call center and technical help desk business to serve the Federal government, staffed by Disabled Veterans. The basic tenet here, is if you accommodate for a Veterans disability, he/she will stay with you longer, yield a lower employee turnover rate, and therefore more experienced customer services.\n\nThe company evolved into offering Identity and Privileged Access Management (IAM & PAM) as a managed service to stop data breaches at government agencies. After IBM vetted our solution, we were appointed a Federal Systems Integrator in Cyber Security, a Small Business Cloud Services Provider, and a Business Partner. We have responded to a DHS RFI proposing IBM\'s SoftLayer FedRAMP FISMA hosting services packaged with our data breach protection managed services. The latter solution complies with NIST & the CSIP.\n\nKey to the success of our developed solutions are the use of a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) composed of three biometric factors, the use of continuous authentication, behavioral analytics, remote data capture and storage of all transaction data, and centralized Federated Enterprise SSO application protection. My proprietary architected solutions obviate the need for CAC cards and typed or keyed-in passwords.\n\nNearly all agencies expressed strong interest in our solution as the best way to stop their problem of data breaches, however they were far more concerned about the strong impact it would have on their fellow workers (teleworkers, outside contractors and Insiders). Essentially the company was ahead of the time to offer and have accepted a strong solution, as mandated in the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s formal request of the Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan (CSIP) for stronger data breach protections.\n\n01/01/2005 - 03/31/2009 - Chief Executive Officer - Third Wave International N.V. Curacao, N.A.\nI was the CEO and technologist for this startup licensed International Telephone Company. We provided international origination and termination of voice telephone calls, sold and provided connectivity to the Internet, created an Island network of wireless links to customers, provided off-site data storage vaults with high security links between their buildings and our facility. We were also planning on launching a high bandwidth ""Triple Play"" offering of fixed and mobile voice, internet access and IPTV. The network was based on using high-security Free Space Optical links and Millimeter Wave Radio systems. Major accomplishments include: 1) Dealt with lack of policing of wireless spectrum; 2) Provided secure collocation facility; 3) Lowest costs for international and domestic voice and data communications.\n\n06/01/2003 - 09/01/2006 \xe2\x80\x93 Chief Financial Officer - Intense School, Inc. Plantation, FL United States\nI served as a part time interim CFO and worked on facilitating, preparing & successfully selling this IT Training and Certification company. When company sale transaction was complete, I went full time on-site as the CEO of Third Wave International NV.\n\n01/01/1998 - 12/31/2001 - VP (M&A) - Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, USVI.\nPrimary function was investigation of mergers and acquisitions of telecom companies in the Caribbean region (Haiti, D.R., Suriname, Barbados & Trinidad). This included due diligence investigations and business case analyses. Major accomplishments included: Designed and assisted with implementation of an off-shore Call Center for Guyana. After an acquisition of a Haitian wireless company, I managed same for over a year and introduced a mobile cellular like offering and a very low-cost two-way domestic and international radio paging system for the poor in this country. While there I also designed and implemented the largest and strongest RF (radio frequency) tower overlooking Port-au-Prince (the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital).\n\n01/01/1995 - 12/31/1997 - VP Sales - Global-Net, Inc. Reston, VA United States\nFor this start-up company I was responsible for selling a wireless local loop product that the company was trying to develop at Virginia Tech. Major accomplishments include: Successfully convinced authorities in Poland to implement and test proposed new system. The product was never developed and subsequently Space Vest of Reston, VA, the owners, shut down the company.\n\nAFFILIATIONS \xe2\x80\x93 MEMBERSHIPS \xe2\x80\x93 CERTIFICATIONS\n\n1.\nSociety of Communications Technology Consultants - Founder, Past President\nNational Defense Industrial Assoc.

I have been consistently impressed by Karla\xe2\x80\x99s attitude towards her work, performance on the job and, most importantly, her level of clinical knowledge and the amount of respect she shows to her co-workers and to those of us in industry. Her interpersonal and communication skills have allowed Karla to excel in every role she has tackled. These qualities have also helped Karla to develop productive working relationships with those she comes in contact with on a daily basis and have earned her the respect of many.\n\nKarla is well-liked by her co-workers and those in industry. She always took ownership in learning, understanding and becoming a product expert for the implants and systems she was often charged with learning to ensure the successful outcome of a surgical case. Karla\xe2\x80\x99s successful track record in all of her roles 1st as a surgical tech, then as a Clinical Specialist and finally as a Clinical Services Manager is evidence of her positive and \xe2\x80\x9cget it done right\xe2\x80\x9d attitude. It also demonstrates both her willingness to lead and the high esteem in which she is generally held.\n\nWhile Karla and I first became acquainted in strictly a business sense, over the years, as is often the case in highly technical device sales, Karla and I became friends and mutually respected the work we did for each other. This last point speaks to Karla\xe2\x80\x99s ability, and really the core of her being, to develop, nurture, respect and understand the value of long term, positive working relationships in business. It is a reward when relationships such as these grow into respectful and meaningful business friendships and alliances.\n\nAlthough I have had many interactions with health care professionals spanning 20 years of medical sales in Minnesota, I can say, without a doubt, Karla is one of my favorite persons to work with and a person I would give the highest recommendation for the any position she seeks. She will be a leader within any role she decides to pursue.\n\nPlease let me know if I can provide you with any further information and thank you for the opportunity to share with you my recommendation of Karla\n\nRespectfully,\n\nBryan Tarrolly\nDistributor-Owner\n1-320-***-****\nac96tc@r.postjobfree.com\nJanuary 26, 2007\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nIt is with great pleasure and honor that I submit to you a recommendation for Karla Boehmke for any position she seeks. I have had the fortunate opportunity to work with Karla in the capacity of strategic and academic leadership for Rasmussen College\xe2\x80\x99s Surgical Technology Program.\nIn this leadership capacity, Karla has been instrumental in providing system-wide governance over curriculum and facility design, requisite supply acquisition, compilation of academic program resources, faculty identification and skills assessment in addition to modeling exemplar classroom management as she implemented this new program for Rasmussen College. This has not been an easy undertaking as Karla was required to manage this project for multiple campuses while supplying a strategic plan for program roll-out to multiple states in which we currently operate and hope to operate in the near future. As such, she has exhibited a true understanding of programmatic requirements, accreditation options and has successfully met the requirements for both of our institutional governing bodies. Her leadership has afforded Rasmussen, in a very short amount of time, the opportunity to become a leader in Surgical Technology.\nIn addition to this responsibility, I appointed Karla as Chairman of our Allied Health Department Chair Counsel. As chair her responsibilities included the research, development and implementation of a system-wide program for the purchasing of Allied Health related supplies. Again, this was to benefit each campus, our multiple Allied Health programs which are offered at multiple locations in multiple states. Further, this committee was charged with creating aligned curriculum where appropriate to aggregate students across the Allied Health programs to ensure the best transfer and articulation among our programs of study. The final project for this committee was to create an Allied Health Manual to align policies and procedures in addition to streamlining our externship/practicum requirements. As such, Karla proposed a corporate strategy which has been successfully implemented to secure practicum sites for Allied Health programs for the system.\nAs you can discern from the aforementioned successes Karla has achieved at Rasmussen she will very much be missed by our organization, however, I am confident Karla will continue to support Rasmussen College and her program as a professional in her field of study. Therefore, please take from this letter my highest recommendation for any position within your organization.\nPlease feel free to contact me at any time.\nWarmest Regards,\n\nDr. Debra J. Volzer\nDirector of Academic Programs\nRasmussen College\nOffice 630-***-**** Cell 614-***-****\nac96tc@r.postjobfree.com\n\nDawn Plested\nFederal Urban Health Network Executive Director\n15858 Birchwood Lane\nBrainerd, MN 56401\nTo Whom it May Concern:\nI am writing this letter in enthusiastic support of Karla Mumm\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy for your open position. I have known Karla in her work at Lakewood Health System beginning in 2016. Based on my own experience with Karla and a review of her work history, I am confident that she has both the ability and the professionalism will make her an outstanding candidate for this, or any position. She brings value to any role she is asked to play and any organization would be lucky to have her as an employee.\nAs a clinical manager at Lakewood Health System, Karla was a disciplined and dedicated patient advocate. Her performance at LHS was exemplary. She did all that was asked of her and more. She displayed hard work and creativity. She was respectful and forceful as appropriate. She was a team player at LHS and she did outstanding work. She was a standout at LHS and I know you would find her to be the same in your organization.\nKarla also impresses me as an unusually conscientious, committed, and mature person. She came to LHS with a long and impressive record of achievement in her personal and professional life. In short, I recommend Karla to you enthusiastically and without reservation. If I can be of any further assistance in your review of her candidacy, please feel free to contact me.\nSincerely,\nDawn Plested\n\nContact this candidate\n'",Technologist,set(['Technologist'])

These generating units need to supply power according to the rules of the grid. These rules involve maintaining a voltage variation within limits and also the frequency.If any deviation from the acceptable limit of the grid it is mandatory that the same feeder should automatically get disconnected from the grid which by effect is termed as islanding. This prevents in large scale brown out or black out of the grid power. So it is preferable to have a system which can warn the grid in advance so that alternate arrangements are kept on standby to avoid complete grid failure.\nThis system is based on a microcontroller of 8051 family. The microcontroller monitors the under/over voltage being derived from a set of comparators. As the frequency of the mains supply cannot be changed, the project uses a variable frequency generator (555-timer) for changing the frequency, while a standard variac is used to vary the input voltage to test the functioning of the project.\nA lamp load (indicating a predictable blackout, brownout) being driven from the microcontroller in case of voltage/frequency going out of acceptable range\nACADEMIC QUALIFICATION\nBachelor of Technology Electrical Engineering 4 Year Program (First Division) From University of Engineering & Technology Peshawar KPK Pakistan (Degree Acknowledge from NATIONAL TECHNALOLGY COUNCIAL PAKISTAN)\n(Session Annual 2010 to 2014)\nThree year Diploma of Associate Engineer Electrical Technology (first Division) Board of Technical Education Peshawar KPK Pakistan.\n(Session Annual 2007 to 2010)\nSecondary School Certificate from Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Dara Ismail Khan KPK Pakistan.\n(Session Annual 2006 to 2007)\n\nSubjects/Skills\nStudied a vast array of subjects related to Electrical, Power, Electronics and Control engineering.
