Reporting – Simple to Enhanced (date export in Excel format included.
System Two - second system enables organizations and engineering teams to:
Work and carry out there tasking without having to interact with ICAM Engineering.
Components & Organizations, at will, can migrate and maintain thousands of CBP Enterprise applications into, and out of CBP's ICAM Infrastructure, self-publish their applications roles quickly and efficiently, take advantage of any custom multi-stage “Self Service” approval, and “On Your Behalf” provisioning workflow available to their application, and provision into ICAM Directory Servers.
Lastly to ensure satisfaction, tracking, trust and loyalty, customers are assigned unique customer ticket numbers.
System Three – This systems purpose focuses on:
X509 Certificate management within the ICAM engineering organization. It provides three functions, they are:
Reporting – Centralized scanning, and alerting on all certificate “aging” within the “ICAM Infrastructure system to interested “communities of interest,
“Expert system for the O&M team,
Provide detailed information on host based information, certificate aging, and
Business Process Management – Within the enterprise, the process of registering X509 Certificate can be a daunting task, fitting the unique needs of the team needed to be custom designed.

Primary Qualities
I am an energetic socio-technologist and a fervent advocate, supporter, and promoter of technological advancement and social progress.
I am a scholar and scientist, researcher and academic, experimenter and critical thinker, inventor and innovator, developer and practitioner, writer and speaker, teacher and trainer, leader and advisor, entrepreneur and consultant, and maverick and pioneer. I think outside the box. I am modern and futuristic.
I am a social activist striving against social conflict, market inefficiency, family dysfunction, human poverty, and health suffering. I seek to promote knowledge, science, educational development, multiculturalism, interactionism, innovative financial engineering, economic growth, equality, conflict resolution, and social cohesion. Targeted Opportunities
R&D INNOVATION / SPECIALTY: Pioneer of “The Sociology of Software Architecture” ACADEMIA:
Passionate Teaching Interest: Sociology of Software Architecture, Software Architecture Development Optimization, Sociology, Sociology of Technology, Sociology of Knowledge Society, Sociology of Information Society, Logic and Philosophy of Science, History of Science, Social Epistemology, and Epistemology Page 1 of 6
Frontier R&D Interest: Synthesis, integration, development, and application of the above interdisciplinary studies.
I have developed an innovative and powerful research methodology (“Scientific Method Regression”). It regresses two distinct and different fields of science to common scientific methodology logic, structure, and tracks. Then it synthesizes and mirrors their development into a novel interdisciplinary study.
I am interested in furthering the horizontal and vertical development of “The Sociology of Software Architecture.” Specific areas of focus are: sociology of search, data science, artificial intelligence, social networking, education technology, and fintech. SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE / DATA SCIENCE / ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY:
Research and development, pioneering applications, team leadership, mentor, teacher, trainer, consultant, advisor, strategist, market vision/mission dev, executive management, board member, partnership, entrepreneurship, speaking, promoting, and publishing. Bio
I am a lifelong academic and software development entrepreneur. In 1995, I advanced to Ph.D. candidacy at UCI (University of California, Irvine). My research was focused on “The Sociology of Technology: The PC Revolution.” Soonafter, I jumped into the internet revolution. I spent 25+ years working on internet related software technology startups. I always approached software architecture development with a strong sociological methods/requirements perspective. As a result of my extensive research and development, and real market experience and application, I pioneered a novel interdisciplinary study methodology, namely “The Sociology of Software Architecture. “
I started my passionate involvement in software development and related technology with the PC Revolution in the mid 1980ies. My early applications were in database marketing, a precursor to data science. I applied powerful, emerging, and advanced statistical modeling to direct response marketing and achieved great results. My next big project was in education technology. My third big project was in local search (CEO of eLocal Network). My latest project was a fintech/data science startup. In 2013, I was granted patent #8489480. I had two other important and innovative patent applications in local search and data anonymity. I returned to academia part time with a Direct Ph.D. at UEL program to develop and publish my research. I just completed a 350 pages Ph.D. thesis/book titled ""The Evolution of Sociology of Software Architecture."" Publishing of this thesis/book is TBA. My goal is to lead a transformation of the software Page 2 of 6
architecture development practice. More research and development in this and related fields of study are in progress.

I applied advanced academic social segmentation statistical and data approaches, models, and techniques to invent and innovate direct marketing targeting and response engagement. My next big three projects were in internet development. This included: education technology, local search, fintech, and their data science components. Furthermore, I have been involved in leading several other startup software development teams and projects. My academic R&D continued with every project. I looked at software architecture and development from a sociological requirements perspective. In addition to one patent (#8489480) and two other innovative patent applications, my academic/career development culminated in my Ph.D. in “Architecture, Page 3 of 6

METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR RESTRUCTURING DEBT
Patent number: 8489480
Abstract: A method and system for restructuring debt are disclosed. The method restructures debt by transferring ownership of defined debt packages from debt holders to third-party debt buyers who function as financial bridges between the debtors and the debt holders. The method accelerates the debt resolution process by executing the debt-restructure agreement early in the debt resolution period, thereby eliminating the need for the debtor to accumulate debt settlement funds in an escrow fund prior to the initiation of settlement negotiations (as is the case in debt settlement), and erasing delinquent debt as soon as the debt-restructure agreement is executed. The method is designed and adapted to execution on a computer network system. Type: Grant

Abstract: A method and system for anonymously matching debtors with debt holders to facilitate resolution of non-performing debt are disclosed. The method and system involve creation of an anonymous debt database such that non-parties to the debt may comply with regulations regarding maintaining confidentiality of debtor information. The anonymous debt database may be made available to be searched by a debtor using one or more anonymous search Page 5 of 6
parameters to identify any debt in the database that is associated with the debtor. The method is designed and adapted to execution on a computer network system. Type: Application

CAPABILITY DOCUMENT AND RESUME FOR MY CORE COMPETENCIES IN:
CYBERSECURITY - TELECOMMUNICATIONS – TRAINING – EXPERT WITNESS
PROJECT MANAGEMENT: NEEDS ANALYSIS / SPECIFICATIONS / RFI, RFP, RFQ / IMPLIMENTATION

Important key facts for any organization that is considering me for a project or position:
1.I have extensive experience in Project Management, managing multiple projects at the same time, in Cybersecurity and Telecommunications. I am currently upgrading to the advanced web-based Project Management tool by SmartSheet, for its superior support of multiple projects, the development of both software (Agile support) and hardware infrastructure, and the updating of project workers & stakeholders anywhere. Projects are normally delivered on time and in compliance with regulations.
2.In Cybersecurity I have architected best & proprietary solutions in Enterprise Identity and Privileged Access Management (IAM & PAM) that stops data breaches and unauthorized infrastructure access, by Enterprise Teleworkers, Outside Contractors and Insiders, as they are attempted. CAC cards and keyed passwords are for the history books, while I do not limit personal liberties. Keys to success is in the combined usage of continuous multifactor biometrics and behavioral analytics.
3.In Telecommunications I have engineered numerous LAN and WAN networks and systems in the most cost effective, efficient and reliable manner to best support an organization’s objectives.
4.My project management contributions usually lead to lower costs, faster problem resolution, higher reliability and availability. Much of this is attributable to my significant and diverse knowledge and experiences which best allow me to anticipate problems before they occur, that can interrupt project tasks, make for missed milestones, and thereby creating additional and unexpected costs.
5.I am excellent when it comes to training others so that they can carry on after my project is completed. As a project, online or in person, I have also trained others in my core competencies.
6.I am exceptionally healthy, physically & intellectually fit, and passionate about the work I do. I look forward to a face to face interview to prove this.
7.Lastly, I am forever a student, always investigating new technologies and products, to seek better solutions for client’s problems and desired improvements.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS (6), CONSULTING PROJECTS (25), & EXPERT WITNESS (15) LITIGATIONS
4/1/2009 to current – Managing Director (Owner), Sr. Consultant & Project Manager - The Technology Consultancy
After returning to the U.S. from my employment contract with Third Wave International NV, in 2009, I restarted my independent consulting practice, conducting projects in Cybersecurity, Distance Learning, Surveillance and building telecom networks. This practice remained operationally while I started and developed CSR-Support LLC. In-fact the revenues generated from consulting clients starting in 2009 was exclusively used to fund CSR-Support’s operations. Between 1995 and 2009 most of the work I did was under Employment contracts. Other recent technology projects were for: FCC (2009) – Louisiana Rural Health Care Network; Big Star Media Group (2011) Developed a solution to optimally stream live music from the Ground Zero Blues Club around the world, and the feasibility of a CLEC for Coahoma County, Mississippi: Jena Industries (2012 – 2015) Designed a call center in Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Nigeria and a microwave systems linking it to an expected ocean fiber landing: APT College (2016-17) Training technicians to obtain a FCC General Radiotelephone Operators license; and continuously provided Expert Witness testimony (15+cases) regarding IT technologies, Shareholder interests, Fraud, Patent infringements, Contracts, and Murder. Earlier consulting projects included: Dreyfus Corporation (Mellon Bank) – advanced brokerage call processing & routing systems for 40 locations around the world; VITELCOM – consulting services for Chase Manhattan Bank for faster check clearing, State Farm Ins.- network configuration, NYC Housing Authority - hundreds of switching systems, and wireless communications for HQ, Police and Emergency services, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.- Fiber Optic Ring network, John Hancock Life Insurance Co – network configurations design and implementation, State Street Bank & Trust Co – switching system for offshore site, British Airways – ground control radio system, The Equitable Insurance Company – network configuration and billing verification, Palmas Del Mar – switching and outside plant, AT&T – independent consulting strategy for 5 years to Board Chairman, Parsons & Whittemore – large PBXs, network designs and wireless systems US & CA, General Motors – voice and data management strategy, Citibank, N.A.- telecom management training, Warner-Amex – satellite communications, Bear Sterns – network interfaces. United Illuminating – Phone Systems and Networks.

Be advised that the times I worked on Employment Contracts, Consulting Agreements & Expert Witness Projects for The Technology Consultancy, may leave time gaps. During these gaps I am working for my consulting company to find and secure my next Employment, Consulting or Expert Witness activity. Secondly, the times I work on these activities may also overlap.

7/13/2012 – 11/11/2017 - Chief Executive Officer - CSR-Support LLC, Alpharetta, GA - SDVOSB
I created this company with the intent to establish a customer service, call center and technical help desk business to serve the Federal government, staffed by Disabled Veterans. The basic tenet here, is if you accommodate for a Veterans disability, he/she will stay with you longer, yield a lower employee turnover rate, and therefore more experienced customer services.

The company evolved into offering Identity and Privileged Access Management (IAM & PAM) as a managed service to stop data breaches at government agencies. After IBM vetted our solution, we were appointed a Federal Systems Integrator in Cyber Security, a Small Business Cloud Services Provider, and a Business Partner. We have responded to a DHS RFI proposing IBM's SoftLayer FedRAMP FISMA hosting services packaged with our data breach protection managed services. The latter solution complies with NIST & the CSIP.

Key to the success of our developed solutions are the use of a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) composed of three biometric factors, the use of continuous authentication, behavioral analytics, remote data capture and storage of all transaction data, and centralized Federated Enterprise SSO application protection. My proprietary architected solutions obviate the need for CAC cards and typed or keyed-in passwords.

Nearly all agencies expressed strong interest in our solution as the best way to stop their problem of data breaches, however they were far more concerned about the strong impact it would have on their fellow workers (teleworkers, outside contractors and Insiders). Essentially the company was ahead of the time to offer and have accepted a strong solution, as mandated in the Federal Government’s formal request of the Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan (CSIP) for stronger data breach protections.

01/01/2005 - 03/31/2009 - Chief Executive Officer - Third Wave International N.V. Curacao, N.A.
I was the CEO and technologist for this startup licensed International Telephone Company. We provided international origination and termination of voice telephone calls, sold and provided connectivity to the Internet, created an Island network of wireless links to customers, provided off-site data storage vaults with high security links between their buildings and our facility. We were also planning on launching a high bandwidth ""Triple Play"" offering of fixed and mobile voice, internet access and IPTV. The network was based on using high-security Free Space Optical links and Millimeter Wave Radio systems. Major accomplishments include: 1) Dealt with lack of policing of wireless spectrum; 2) Provided secure collocation facility; 3) Lowest costs for international and domestic voice and data communications.

06/01/2003 - 09/01/2006 – Chief Financial Officer - Intense School, Inc. Plantation, FL United States
I served as a part time interim CFO and worked on facilitating, preparing & successfully selling this IT Training and Certification company. When company sale transaction was complete, I went full time on-site as the CEO of Third Wave International NV.

01/01/1998 - 12/31/2001 - VP (M&A) - Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, USVI.
Primary function was investigation of mergers and acquisitions of telecom companies in the Caribbean region (Haiti, D.R., Suriname, Barbados & Trinidad). This included due diligence investigations and business case analyses. Major accomplishments included: Designed and assisted with implementation of an off-shore Call Center for Guyana. After an acquisition of a Haitian wireless company, I managed same for over a year and introduced a mobile cellular like offering and a very low-cost two-way domestic and international radio paging system for the poor in this country. While there I also designed and implemented the largest and strongest RF (radio frequency) tower overlooking Port-au-Prince (the nation’s capital).

01/01/1995 - 12/31/1997 - VP Sales - Global-Net, Inc. Reston, VA United States
For this start-up company I was responsible for selling a wireless local loop product that the company was trying to develop at Virginia Tech. Major accomplishments include: Successfully convinced authorities in Poland to implement and test proposed new system. The product was never developed and subsequently Space Vest of Reston, VA, the owners, shut down the company.

To Whom It May Concern

I have known Karla Mumm, for the past 15 year while working as both a sales representative and as a distributor-owner. I have been consistently impressed by Karla’s attitude towards her work, performance on the job and, most importantly, her level of clinical knowledge and the amount of respect she shows to her co-workers and to those of us in industry. Her interpersonal and communication skills have allowed Karla to excel in every role she has tackled. These qualities have also helped Karla to develop productive working relationships with those she comes in contact with on a daily basis and have earned her the respect of many.

Karla is well-liked by her co-workers and those in industry. She always took ownership in learning, understanding and becoming a product expert for the implants and systems she was often charged with learning to ensure the successful outcome of a surgical case. Karla’s successful track record in all of her roles 1st as a surgical tech, then as a Clinical Specialist and finally as a Clinical Services Manager is evidence of her positive and “get it done right” attitude. It also demonstrates both her willingness to lead and the high esteem in which she is generally held.

While Karla and I first became acquainted in strictly a business sense, over the years, as is often the case in highly technical device sales, Karla and I became friends and mutually respected the work we did for each other. This last point speaks to Karla’s ability, and really the core of her being, to develop, nurture, respect and understand the value of long term, positive working relationships in business. It is a reward when relationships such as these grow into respectful and meaningful business friendships and alliances.

Although I have had many interactions with health care professionals spanning 20 years of medical sales in Minnesota, I can say, without a doubt, Karla is one of my favorite persons to work with and a person I would give the highest recommendation for the any position she seeks. She will be a leader within any role she decides to pursue.

Please let me know if I can provide you with any further information and thank you for the opportunity to share with you my recommendation of Karla

Respectfully,

To whom it may concern,

It is with great pleasure and honor that I submit to you a recommendation for Karla Boehmke for any position she seeks. I have had the fortunate opportunity to work with Karla in the capacity of strategic and academic leadership for Rasmussen College’s Surgical Technology Program.
In this leadership capacity, Karla has been instrumental in providing system-wide governance over curriculum and facility design, requisite supply acquisition, compilation of academic program resources, faculty identification and skills assessment in addition to modeling exemplar classroom management as she implemented this new program for Rasmussen College. This has not been an easy undertaking as Karla was required to manage this project for multiple campuses while supplying a strategic plan for program roll-out to multiple states in which we currently operate and hope to operate in the near future. As such, she has exhibited a true understanding of programmatic requirements, accreditation options and has successfully met the requirements for both of our institutional governing bodies. Her leadership has afforded Rasmussen, in a very short amount of time, the opportunity to become a leader in Surgical Technology.
In addition to this responsibility, I appointed Karla as Chairman of our Allied Health Department Chair Counsel. As chair her responsibilities included the research, development and implementation of a system-wide program for the purchasing of Allied Health related supplies. Again, this was to benefit each campus, our multiple Allied Health programs which are offered at multiple locations in multiple states. Further, this committee was charged with creating aligned curriculum where appropriate to aggregate students across the Allied Health programs to ensure the best transfer and articulation among our programs of study. The final project for this committee was to create an Allied Health Manual to align policies and procedures in addition to streamlining our externship/practicum requirements. As such, Karla proposed a corporate strategy which has been successfully implemented to secure practicum sites for Allied Health programs for the system.
As you can discern from the aforementioned successes Karla has achieved at Rasmussen she will very much be missed by our organization, however, I am confident Karla will continue to support Rasmussen College and her program as a professional in her field of study. Therefore, please take from this letter my highest recommendation for any position within your organization.
Please feel free to contact me at any time.
Warmest Regards,

To Whom it May Concern:
I am writing this letter in enthusiastic support of Karla Mumm’s candidacy for your open position. I have known Karla in her work at Lakewood Health System beginning in 2016. Based on my own experience with Karla and a review of her work history, I am confident that she has both the ability and the professionalism will make her an outstanding candidate for this, or any position. She brings value to any role she is asked to play and any organization would be lucky to have her as an employee.
As a clinical manager at Lakewood Health System, Karla was a disciplined and dedicated patient advocate. Her performance at LHS was exemplary. She did all that was asked of her and more. She displayed hard work and creativity. She was respectful and forceful as appropriate. She was a team player at LHS and she did outstanding work. She was a standout at LHS and I know you would find her to be the same in your organization.
Karla also impresses me as an unusually conscientious, committed, and mature person. She came to LHS with a long and impressive record of achievement in her personal and professional life. In short, I recommend Karla to you enthusiastically and without reservation. If I can be of any further assistance in your review of her candidacy, please feel free to contact me.

This one stop shop of pre- qualified selected agencies has taken off burden from service requesters and simplifies agency selection.

I am unusual in that I like to do a lot of different jobs, at all levels in the digital marketing world, but I always make sure to keep busy with my #1 passion: designing impressive digital content and user experiences for cool brands. I want you to hire me to make beautiful things, if that’s what you need.

Auto Bravado's ideas on the the Trucks or Cars Miles per Gallon: We all want better numbers, but do we really know how to get them? Let us learn that to get results is to have fun! There are tricks that it took many mechanics decades of experience to figure out and perfect.
Above is how this website started, I'm trying to broaden it's view into repairs and tool reviews.
Car Miles Per Gallon by AutoBravado
http://carmilespergallon.blogspot.com/
This websites focus has shifted over the years to be a publication of my knowledge as inspired by YouTube Automotive knowledge. I consider it a review of others creations, but I certainly add of my own knowledge and experience as I go.
What have I learned about the car's mpg (miles per gallon) lately?

http://carmpg.blogspot.com/
Like all my websites, I focused on the car's or truck's miles per gallon for many years, and this website has shifted in purpose to automotive repair.
Truck Miles Per Gallon
http://truckmilespergallon.blogspot.com/
I've found it more challenging to find out how to increase my truck's ability to get a good miles per gallon because I've never been a truck owner until this Nissan Frontier 4X4. It may be more challenging to figure out how to improve it's miles per gallon more because I'm learning how to drive it for good fuel mileage.
I've tried my hand at performance modifications and I teach from real world results.
Flowmaster Muffler and Magnaflow Exhaust
http://virileauto.blogspot.com/
The first trick to understanding your magnaflow muffler and exhaust tubing is that you'll want to go larger to get more performance and better efficiency, but discover if you're going too far. I learned quickly what was going too far! (Before I ever modified my own car.)
Efficiency by and large for many years was my focus, but occasionally when I did work on getting more power (for efficiency for me) it had a consequence of more power. When this happy occasion comes up, this website gets updated.

I am married with 3 children, ages 23,22, and 18. I am a Fort Wayne native, and relocated back to Fort Wayne in 2001. I am willing to relocate for the right position. I have worked in OB/GYN for 15 years and consider it a privilege to be able to play a small part of a family’s growth. I’m passionate about Women’s Health, and have been told by patients that they appreciate my putting them at ease during what could be considered awkward or embarrassing exams. Patient care and empathy is just as important to me as is obtaining diagnostically consistent images. I’m quite comfortable with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester exams, Nuchal Cord evaluation, Cord Dopplers, MCA Dopplers, Biophysical Profiles, High Risk Pregnancies, Cervical Evaluation, 3D/4D Ultrasound, and Transabdominal Transvaginal pelvic exams. I can initiate NST exams, get patient vitals and obtain urine samples for urinalysis or pregnancy testing.
I work very well on my own or as a team player. While working OB/GYN, I have also done occasional limited and complete Abdominal, Renal, and Thyroid exams. If needed, I have also done Venus Doppler and Carotid Ultrasounds.
Please consider me for this position as I am looking forward to being a vital part in your practice.

“Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering 4 Year Degree Project”
Detecting Power Grid Synchronization Failure on Sensing Frequency or Voltage beyond Acceptable Range
The project is designed to develop a system to detect the synchronization failure of any external supply source of the power grid on sensing the abnormalities in frequency and voltage.
There are several power generation units connected to the grid such as hydel, thermal, solar etc to supply power to the load. These generating units need to supply power according to the rules of the grid. These rules involve maintaining a voltage variation within limits and also the frequency.If any deviation from the acceptable limit of the grid it is mandatory that the same feeder should automatically get disconnected from the grid which by effect is termed as islanding. This prevents in large scale brown out or black out of the grid power. So it is preferable to have a system which can warn the grid in advance so that alternate arrangements are kept on standby to avoid complete grid failure.
This system is based on a microcontroller of 8051 family. The microcontroller monitors the under/over voltage being derived from a set of comparators. As the frequency of the mains supply cannot be changed, the project uses a variable frequency generator (555-timer) for changing the frequency, while a standard variac is used to vary the input voltage to test the functioning of the project.
A lamp load (indicating a predictable blackout, brownout) being driven from the microcontroller in case of voltage/frequency going out of acceptable range
