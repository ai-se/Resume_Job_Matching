Applicants who wish to qualify for positions at higher grade levels (generally grade GS-7 and above) must also meet the requirements shown in the on page IV-A-22, in addition to meeting the basic requirements.\nThe individual occupational requirements typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic requirements of the occupations covered by this standard: Successful completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor\'s or higher degree that included a major field of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in paragraph A in the individual occupational requirements.\nWhere specific course requirements are not indicated in paragraph A, the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses that may be accepted as part of the program major.

Therefore, creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation. The individual occupational requirements for some series make no provision for combining experience and education. Therefore, they do not include paragraph B provisions.\nFor a small number of occupations or positions covered by this standard, applicants may possess certain kinds of experience in lieu of education. In such cases, applicants may meet minimum qualification requirements through experience equivalent to a 4-year degree. These situations are generally described in paragraph C of the individual occupational requirements.\nApplicants whose experience is used to meet the basic requirements through a paragraph B or C provision may qualify for grades above the entry level if that experience includes 1 year of specialized experience. In such cases, the specialized experience would have to be evaluated to determine if it is at the appropriate grade level in the normal line of progression.\n\nAdditional information\n\nRecruitment incentives may be authorized to eligible new hires.\n\nA relocation incentive is generally a single payment intended to offset some of the relocation costs experienced by the selectee.

Specialized experience must demonstrate the following: Responsible to conduct information systems engineering activities, perform oversight of information systems and cyber engineering tasks related to Naval enterprise communications and strategic messaging.\n\nAdditional qualification information can be found from the following Office of Personnel Management web site: .\n\nExperience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., professional, philanthropic, religious, spiritual, community, student, social). Volunteer work helps build critical competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and experience that translates directly to paid employment.\n\nEducation\n\nBasic requirements for all grades Applicants who meet the basic requirements described in the individual occupational requirements are fully qualified for the specified entry grade (generally grade GS-5). Applicants who wish to qualify for positions at higher grade levels (generally grade GS-7 and above) must also meet the requirements shown in the on page IV-A-22, in addition to meeting the basic requirements.\nThe individual occupational requirements typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic requirements of the occupations covered by this standard:\n\nSuccessful completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor\'s or higher degree that included a major field of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in paragraph A in the individual occupational requirements.\nWhere specific course requirements are not indicated in paragraph A, the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses that may be accepted as part of the program major.\nAppropriate combination of education and experience that is typically specified in paragraph B of the individual occupational requirements. The ""paragraph B"" method generally requires that an applicant possess a core of educational credit, such as described in paragraph A above, plus additional education and/or experience. The method of determining the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the same as described in paragraph A.\nThe quality of the combination of education and experience must be sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform work in the occupation, and is comparable to that normally acquired through the successful completion of a full 4-year course of study with a major in the appropriate field. In addition to courses in the major and related fields, a typical college degree would have included courses that involved analysis, writing, critical thinking, research, etc. These courses would have provided an applicant with skills and abilities sufficient to perform progressively more responsible work in the occupation. Therefore, creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation. The individual occupational requirements for some series make no provision for combining experience and education. Therefore, they do not include paragraph B provisions.\nFor a small number of occupations or positions covered by this standard, applicants may possess certain kinds of experience in lieu of education. In such cases, applicants may meet minimum qualification requirements through experience equivalent to a 4-year degree. These situations are generally described in paragraph C of the individual occupational requirements.\nApplicants whose experience is used to meet the basic requirements through a paragraph B or C provision may qualify for grades above the entry level if that experience includes 1 year of specialized experience. In such cases, the specialized experience would have to be evaluated to determine if it is at the appropriate grade level in the normal line of progression.\n\nAdditional information\n\nRecruitment incentives may be authorized to eligible new hires.\n\nA relocation incentive is generally a single payment intended to offset some of the relocation costs experienced by the selectee. A relocation incentive may be authorized.\n\nThis position is eligible for part time, full time or ad-hoc telework at the discretion of management.\n\nGenerally, current Federal employees applying for STRL jobs must serve at least one year at the next lower grade level.
