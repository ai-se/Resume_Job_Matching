Mixing slag with molten steel deteriorates the quality of the final product and destroys refractories. I have been assigned the task to install, commission and integrate AMEPA ladle slag detection system into continuous casting machine process control system. PLC and HMI programming has been done to integrate the system in our industrial automation network. Communication (PROFIBUS and Ethernet) has been established between slag detection system and process control network to exchange data. Project was a complete success. Operation was smooth. System integration was a success. We managed to exchange data and receive the status of the slag detection system during operation.\n\nBAGHOUSE (Fume Treatment Plant) Optimization\nEnergy saving, is the BAGHOUSE Optimization project main target.

Drawings have been reviewed and modified. It is still ongoing project.\nOperating hot billets in billet conditioning machine\nThe main target is to be able to operate hot billets until it reaches the final inspection table. The main challenge is the very high temperature of the hot billets. It can reach up to 470OC. Such a temperature can easily destroy photo electric cells which define the exact location at which the billet will be stopped on the inspection roller table. We had to investigate the options for new types of sensor which can measure the distance of the approaching hot billet. Laser distance sensor has been employed. Laser beam comes out from the sensor and the reflection of it from the billet cross section of the hot billet defines the distance travelled by the billet on roller table. At a certain st-point billet is stopped.\nNew transformers integration into IVACO substation\nAging transformers, T1 & T2, are being replaced with new ones. The main challenge is to integrate the new transforms in the old substation. Drawings for the existing control, protection and paralleling circuits.

This involved interfacing with lots of external systems for Billing, Provisioning, Status tracking, etc. The front end part, which implies the UI using which the order is placed, takes lots of processing after the order is placed by customer like Order Decomposition, where we decompose the Order and send it to appropriate systems for processing it( Ex: Billing, Provisioning etc ). This part of order decomposition is the centralized part of the whole application where all the processing starts from here. Interfacing with other systems was done using XML over HTTP. This was the basic way of communication where in we used to send XML request with respect to the business details which has to be sent to that system and wait for a response from it. Here there was a concept of synchronous and asynchronous where the response could be any of these, based on the system which is processing it. From architecture point of view, we had followed Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. But AT&T had their own implementation of this.\n\nContribution and Responsibilities:\nClient interaction for handling the requirements and development issues, also including discussions on business logic involved in the application.

The task also included schedule preparation, planning, review of technical documents, and the writing of technical reports. Training include Hazardous waste worker and Radiological worker at Hanford\xe2\x80\x99s training center.\n\nURS/Bechtel/DOE, WTP site at Hanford, Washington (3-17-08 to 12-09-08)\nGeneral Superintendent Instrumentation: Instrumentation was to begin in the LAW building where planning, purchasing of specialty tools, materials for hangers, supports, and tray were to be purchased, but upper management did not support instrumentation at this time, and gave all resources to the Civil department. I requested a release and it was granted on 12-09-08.\n\nWGINT/Parsons/COE, Chemical Weapons Demolition Facility at Shchuch\xe2\x80\x99ye, Russia (April 2005 to December 2006).\nInstrumentation Engineer: My duties included the planning and scheduling the construction of the Main Production building, receiving and tracking of mechanical equipment, site walk downs, and whatever our management deem necessary for the enhancement of the project. In December 2006 the COE ordered all Patriots to return to the USA, and for the Russian government to finish the project.\n\nWGINT/Parsons/COE, Chemical Weapons Demolition Facility at Pine Bluff, Arkansas (Nov. 2000 to May 2003)\nGeneral Superintendent Instrumentation: Manage manual and non-manual personnel in the installation instrumentation with documentation, including loop checks of all electrical instruments. Coordination of tools, material, and equipment needed to support the installation. Assign work to meet schedules and milestones while maintaining rotating equipment during construction.

Job Rules and Safety Rules that was required of all site personnel were enforced. The answer to \xe2\x80\x9cBomb Threats\xe2\x80\x9d was to clear the sight of nonessential personnel while a search was conducted. There were no explosive devices found on site during the 13 abusive calls.\n\nMorrison Construction Co./ A-K Steel, Rockport, Indiana,(February 1998 to May 1999)\nPipefitter: Working on the project in my craft on the most enjoyable job ever. The project was the most automated plant that I have worked. We piped up a huge machine that was similar to a paper machine of hydraulics, air, water, and a lot of automatic controls. We met each morning for assignments, and a safety meeting.\n\nRaytheon/PSE&G, Salem I Nuclear Power Plant, Salem, New Jersey (May 1996 thru August 1997)\nField Engineer/Instrumentation/Civil (Iron workers): Our job was to replace the Steam Generators and install new piping and instrumentation due to the fact the new generator were not like for like generators.\nThe lifts were 420 tons each including the rigging inside the Reactor Containment Building. Safety was a priority for the protection of personnel and equipment. Radiation protection was also a requirement due to the fact that the vessels were \xe2\x80\x9cCrapped up\xe2\x80\x9d. We moved these vessels across the Containment building through the equipment hatch then lowered to ground elevation for temporary storage.\n\nRaytheon/TVA, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Unit #1, Spring City, Tenn.,(Jan.1992 thru June 1994)\nField Engineer Mechanical: Responsible for the craft installing small & large bore piping, hangers, supports that they install these items by drawings, and procedures. Any variance had to be recorded and approve by design engineering. The same was true for instrumentation, and duct work. All work had to be documented, signed off, and issued to the vault.\n\nMilton J. Wood Co./Meade Paper Mill, Eufaula, Alabama, (Jan. 1991 to Dec. 1991)\nProject Manager: Replaced the steam and black liquor piping both in the inside and outside the vertical continuous digester during the overhaul of the vessel. The vessel stands 300 ft. and the vessel opening was on top limiting the length of pipe to be lifted. A scaffold had to be built inside the vessel for fit-up of piping, and the installation of struts & hangers. Safety was a real concern and had to be continually monitored.\n\nR.N. Pyle Co./St. Joe Paper Mill, Port St., Florida (Feb. 1990 to August 1990)\nProject Manager: Fabricated & installed a piping system throughout the Pulp Mill for the collection of a poisonous gas, and to be delivered to the Lime Kilns for burning. Several old vessels & piping were demolished and new vessels installed without shutting the plant down. Coordinating our work with plant operations was a must as safety which had to be carefully monitored.\n\nFluor Constructors/Southeast University Fluidizing Bed Boiler, Cape Girardeau, Mo. (Feb.1988 to Nov. 1989)\nProject Manager: Replaced existing boiler with an experimental Fluidizing Bed Boiler that included a new control room, bag house, pumps, compressors, piping, instrumentation, and a new roof on the existing building.

That included all open items from turnover, and NCR\xe2\x80\x99s, & FCR\xe2\x80\x99s with signed-off documentation. The piping craft completed the testing of all piping systems with signed-off documentation. We completed all mechanical engineering change orders including the purchase of required materials and equipment. On some occasions we were required to use multi-craft personnel during our testing, and the completion of open items. Once all testing had been completed and the documentation in the vault we completed Cold Hydro and Hot Functional testing with the support of Ebasco\xe2\x80\x99s Start-up Group. My most important function was enforcing job and safety rules while protecting permanent equipment.\n\nMcCartin, McAuliffe Mechanical Contractor/Illinois Power, Clinton Nuclear Power Plant,\n(1978-1979)\nMechanical Superintendent: This project was a two shift operations whereas I covered the second shift with multi-crafts doing rollover work from the day shift. We covered Piping, hangers, condenser tubes, structural steel, and scaffolding while maintaining our documentation, enforcing Job and Safety rules.\n\nDaniels Construction/ Kansas City Power & Light/ Wolf Creek Nuclear Plant (1977-1978)\nContainment Piping Superintendent: The plant was in its infancy, and we were bringing the vessel out of the ground. Our task was to install embedded piping, and pipe sleeves ahead of concrete pours. Testing was required for embedded pipe joints. Planning was essential at this stage of construction as well as the enforcement of Job & safety rules.\n\nDaniels/Bechtel/Alabama Power, Farley Nuclear Plant (1973-1976)\nPiping Superintendent/ Start-up Superintendent: In the beginning my crews were installing small & large bore pipe, and later advancing to hangers, struts, & supports. Then moving on to instrumentation throughout the plant. In 1974 we moved into flushing & testing of all piping & equipment in the plant & yard.\nIn our early we had to learn how to document our work in the prepared \xe2\x80\x9cwork packages\xe2\x80\x9d. We also had to work safely, and abide by Safety procedures, and Job rules. OSHA was new at the time which gave us new dimensions of safety. Our performance progressed and we moved on to Cold Hydro, and Hot functional testing with the support of Start-up group. A short time later Farley Nuclear Unit #1 was put on line.\n\nPrior to 1973 and between management assignments today, I work and have worked as a craftsman on numerous projects throughout the United States. The Nuclear Plant \xe2\x80\x9cOutages\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cShutdowns\xe2\x80\x9d on Paper Mills, Fossil Fuel Power Plants, Chemical Plants, and Refinery have been omitted due to the lack of spacing on resume.\n\nEducation and Training:\nHigh School Graduate (GED)\nPipefitters Apprenticeship Program (5 years) Graduated\nAttended Pensacola Junior College\n\nMilitary Service;\nU.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman, 1st Marine Div., Korea\nHonorable Discharged (4 years\xe2\x80\x99 service)\n\nI am available to work foreign assignments.\n\nContact this candidate\n'",Engineer,set(['Engineer'])

Preferred the traveling and service aspect of the job a lot more.\nBack to service for 3 years traveling full time.\nFor the last 10 years I travel some but took over the phone support and scheduling of the service techs. This makes me the one the techs are calling from the field for support. This is a lot harder than troubleshooting the equipment.

Some techs are not like that, they want me or engineering to make all the decisions for them.\n\nNegatives, every tech has both positive and negative attributes. Putting the right tech on the right job can be hard, here are mine.\nI am a not the best trainer, my problem is I know multiple ways to do things and when I train I tell them the various ways. I tell the customer to use a way that works for them. This is bad because a lot of customers only want to hear one way to do a task.\nI do not like training large groups. I get nervous if there are too many people watching me. I have trained up to 40 people in a class room before but I prefer 1 to 5 people at the machine. I could never be a public speaker.\nMy desk is a mess, although I know where everything is and it is a revolving mess.\nI am a programmer and can do board level repair but I am not an engineering level programmer. I make changes as needed for production and upgrades but have never started a program from scratch.\nWhen I make modifications, I tend to look at what I have on hand and how to make that work, rather than the best way to do it and what materials we need to get.\n\nAdvance Possis\nMaintenance tech\n11-97 to 06-08\nTasks; repair, setup, and maintain equipment on an assembly line.\nAt this position I was on a prototype line.

This has helped me greatly during my time as an IT Support Technician at Flint Hill School. I have a thirst for knowledge and learning about the latest tech which is the reason I still work for Apple part time. At Flint Hill I have many responsibilities ranging from troubleshooting software, repairing Macs, controlling content on the network through the web \xef\xac\x81lter, and managing devices using Jamf Pro\xe2\x80\x99s MDM solution. I am part of the team that manages and supports the One-to-One program for the Macs and iPads. Primarily, my time is spent planning for purchases, supervising device distribution, and facilitating the roll out of new technology through Apple DEP and Apple School Manager. Along with that, I help \xef\xac\x81nd solutions to problems and answers to questions pertaining to the program. I am currently testing, planning and \xef\xac\x81nalizing the roll out of our Two-to-One program for the middle school, where each student will have both an iPad and a MacBook Air to use for their studies. At Apple I help direct, lead, and grow a very technical group of Mac Geniuses. I have comprehensive experience with sales ranging from individual consumer to large companies with the business team. I also have expertise in inventory management, leadership, and continued motivation and training of my peers. Throughout my time at Apple I have played a key role in launching, promoting and supporting world- changing products and services. As one of the original Apple retail employees, I had the privilege of going through highly specialized training for interacting with customers and facilitated in creating a credo that ties the customer\xe2\x80\x99s needs as a \xef\xac\x81lter for everything we do. I personally collaborated with Steve Jobs on \xe2\x80\x98Project Nexus\xe2\x80\x99; the planning and launch of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s retail endeavor. As of today, Apple Retail is critical to their success and responsible for almost $100 billion dollars a year of net revenue; helping it become the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable company. The training and on boarding process I have experienced leads me to \xef\xac\x81rmly believe that when working with a customer, I\xe2\x80\x99m not just providing service- it\xe2\x80\x99s about giving each person an experience that will enrich their life. This has always proved bene\xef\xac\x81cial to me at creating rapport, establishing relationships and building trust with people of all ages.

He has a solid understanding of engineering principles, in particular, related to the oil and gas sector. What I found valuable while working with Rito is the good commercial acumen he possesses, and importantly, a calm nature and clear mind while working under pressure. I would recommend Rito for a role where commercial decision making within a technical industry in a segment that is going through change needs a solid and reliable decision maker to drive results.\n\nKim Dumagco\nRetail Territory Manager at Shell\nJanuary 26, 2018, Kim reported directly to Rito\n\nI consider working with Sir Rex as an important part of my early years in the sales industry, particularly in the Petroleum. Sir Rex became one of my line managers in Mawab. He handled five talented sales individuals including me. Coming from different multinational companies including Total, he brought a lot of Global standards to a local company when it comes to work ethic, values, disciplines, and performance. Sir Rex was definitely not just an experienced Manager but an asset to Mawab back then. As a Boss, he was very passionate in delivering performance and growth not just to the company but to all of his subordinates as well. He has very good skills in managing and handling people. In fact, I consider him as a people person with high capacity of a strategic thinker. His coaching skills add up to his list of his managerial competencies. He goes well with millennial and I think that is an advantage. Another good quality of Sir Rex is that he is data driven. He knows how to analyze and present data to his team and translate it to workable plan. And most of the time, his decisions were based on insights derived from data. Sir Rex has the right attitude and mindset of a good Manager/Boss. He can bring out the best in you if let him coach you and help you. Working with him helped me acquire necessary skills which I consider as part of my current knowledge and ability right now. As a produce of Sir Rex, I am now working for the single-biggest branded petroleum company in the world as a Retail Territory Manager, and I would not be able to reach this point if I did not met Sir Rex and became his subordinate. I recommend him to companies needing a valuable asset because I know he possess high capacity, experience, and potential.\n\nContact this candidate\n'",Engineer,set(['Engineer'])
