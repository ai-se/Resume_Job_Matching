Modifying PLC program improve the equipment performance.

Ladle Slag Detection Project, AMEPA
Slag detection is a major process problem in steel making industry. Mixing slag with molten steel deteriorates the quality of the final product and destroys refractories. I have been assigned the task to install, commission and integrate AMEPA ladle slag detection system into continuous casting machine process control system. PLC and HMI programming has been done to integrate the system in our industrial automation network. Communication (PROFIBUS and Ethernet) has been established between slag detection system and process control network to exchange data. Project was a complete success. Operation was smooth. System integration was a success. We managed to exchange data and receive the status of the slag detection system during operation.

BAGHOUSE (Fume Treatment Plant) Optimization
Energy saving, is the BAGHOUSE Optimization project main target. To achieve this task, we are planning to automatically control the percentage of opening of Meltshop plant fume dampers, control the speeds of medium voltage suction motors and burn the dioxins and furans organic particles. I have been assigned the task of reviewing PLC programming, instrumentations’ and drawings of Consteel and Baghouse. Quenching tower area of the Consteel plant has been completely recommissioned, new sensors have been added, A lot of modifications have been made in Consteel and BAGHOUSE PLCs. Drawings have been reviewed and modified. It is still ongoing project.
Operating hot billets in billet conditioning machine
The main target is to be able to operate hot billets until it reaches the final inspection table. The main challenge is the very high temperature of the hot billets. It can reach up to 470OC. Such a temperature can easily destroy photo electric cells which define the exact location at which the billet will be stopped on the inspection roller table. We had to investigate the options for new types of sensor which can measure the distance of the approaching hot billet. Laser distance sensor has been employed. Laser beam comes out from the sensor and the reflection of it from the billet cross section of the hot billet defines the distance travelled by the billet on roller table. At a certain st-point billet is stopped.
New transformers integration into IVACO substation
Aging transformers, T1 & T2, are being replaced with new ones. The main challenge is to integrate the new transforms in the old substation.

Grim:
The obligatory trade reporting of UK Gilts to London Stock Exchange is handled by an application called “Grim” within the Deutsche Bank infrastructure which receives the trade data from Trade Manager. The objective of the project is to define the business and legal requirements on UK Gilts primary market deals which need to be excluded from the Gilt trade reporting to the London Stock Exchange through the GRIM application. The reporting should exclude all primary market deals done the 1st tranche of a new issue or any other following tranches (tap) as well as our purchases between Deutsche Bank and other market makers, since only the seller is obliged to report to London Stock Exchange. The existing logic in GRIM filters the above mentioned trades insufficiently and causes complaints addressed by the London Stock exchange to Deutsche Bank’s compliance team, creating the risk of fines being imposed by the regulator . Further to the suppression of primary market deals, trades with low trading volume should be reported. The current logic in GRIM is rounding down to zero and suppressing the trade reporting which causes an underreporting.

Order processing system is a complex software application which dealt with creation of Orders/placing the orders for the customers of AT&T with respect to the products or services provided by AT&T. This involved interfacing with lots of external systems for Billing, Provisioning, Status tracking, etc. The front end part, which implies the UI using which the order is placed, takes lots of processing after the order is placed by customer like Order Decomposition, where we decompose the Order and send it to appropriate systems for processing it( Ex: Billing, Provisioning etc ). This part of order decomposition is the centralized part of the whole application where all the processing starts from here. Interfacing with other systems was done using XML over HTTP. This was the basic way of communication where in we used to send XML request with respect to the business details which has to be sent to that system and wait for a response from it. Here there was a concept of synchronous and asynchronous where the response could be any of these, based on the system which is processing it. From architecture point of view, we had followed Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. But AT&T had their own implementation of this.

Contribution and Responsibilities:

Work History:
URS/DOE, Tank Farms at Hanford, Washington (8-09-10 to 02-03-11)
Contract Manager: as overseer of the work of a sub-contractor in the erection of a prefabricated 70,000 sq. ft. metal Office/Warehouse with most all amenities on radiological contaminated land. The project was supported by URS Engineers, Quality Control, and Safety Representatives. Support was also included by Hanford’s electrical and water utility departments, and radiation protection inspectors. The task also included schedule preparation, planning, review of technical documents, and the writing of technical reports. Training include Hazardous waste worker and Radiological worker at Hanford’s training center.

URS/Bechtel/DOE, WTP site at Hanford, Washington (3-17-08 to 12-09-08)
General Superintendent Instrumentation: Instrumentation was to begin in the LAW building where planning, purchasing of specialty tools, materials for hangers, supports, and tray were to be purchased, but upper management did not support instrumentation at this time, and gave all resources to the Civil department. I requested a release and it was granted on 12-09-08.

WGINT/Parsons/COE, Chemical Weapons Demolition Facility at Shchuch’ye, Russia (April 2005 to December 2006).
Instrumentation Engineer: My duties included the planning and scheduling the construction of the Main Production building, receiving and tracking of mechanical equipment, site walk downs, and whatever our management deem necessary for the enhancement of the project. In December 2006 the COE ordered all Patriots to return to the USA, and for the Russian government to finish the project.

WGINT/Parsons/COE, Chemical Weapons Demolition Facility at Pine Bluff, Arkansas (Nov. 2000 to May 2003)
General Superintendent Instrumentation: Manage manual and non-manual personnel in the installation instrumentation with documentation, including loop checks of all electrical instruments. Coordination of tools, material, and equipment needed to support the installation. Assign work to meet schedules and milestones while maintaining rotating equipment during construction. Enforcement of Site Job rules and Safety Procedures, and applying disciplinary action where required. Being the last manager on the project I was responsible for the completion of all punch list items, and the turnover of all remaining documentation.

Raytheon/Parsons/COE, Chemical Weapons Demolition Facility at Hermiston, Oregon (May 1999 to Nov. 2000)
General Superintendent Instrumentation/ Piping: Coordinated the purchase and delivery of specialty tools, material, and equipment with the Corps of Engineers. A schedule of instrumentation installation to meet site milestones was maintained during construction. Rotating equipment was maintained during construction. Job Rules and Safety Rules that was required of all site personnel were enforced. The answer to “Bomb Threats” was to clear the sight of nonessential personnel while a search was conducted. There were no explosive devices found on site during the 13 abusive calls.

Morrison Construction Co./ A-K Steel, Rockport, Indiana,(February 1998 to May 1999)
Pipefitter: Working on the project in my craft on the most enjoyable job ever. The project was the most automated plant that I have worked. We piped up a huge machine that was similar to a paper machine of hydraulics, air, water, and a lot of automatic controls. We met each morning for assignments, and a safety meeting.

Raytheon/PSE&G, Salem I Nuclear Power Plant, Salem, New Jersey (May 1996 thru August 1997)
Field Engineer/Instrumentation/Civil (Iron workers): Our job was to replace the Steam Generators and install new piping and instrumentation due to the fact the new generator were not like for like generators.
The lifts were 420 tons each including the rigging inside the Reactor Containment Building. Safety was a priority for the protection of personnel and equipment. Radiation protection was also a requirement due to the fact that the vessels were “Crapped up”. We moved these vessels across the Containment building through the equipment hatch then lowered to ground elevation for temporary storage.

Raytheon/TVA, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Unit #1, Spring City, Tenn.,(Jan.1992 thru June 1994)
Field Engineer Mechanical: Responsible for the craft installing small & large bore piping, hangers, supports that they install these items by drawings, and procedures. Any variance had to be recorded and approve by design engineering. The same was true for instrumentation, and duct work. All work had to be documented, signed off, and issued to the vault.

Milton J. Wood Co./Meade Paper Mill, Eufaula, Alabama, (Jan. 1991 to Dec. 1991)
Project Manager: Replaced the steam and black liquor piping both in the inside and outside the vertical continuous digester during the overhaul of the vessel. The vessel stands 300 ft. and the vessel opening was on top limiting the length of pipe to be lifted. A scaffold had to be built inside the vessel for fit-up of piping, and the installation of struts & hangers. Safety was a real concern and had to be continually monitored.

R.N. Pyle Co./St. Joe Paper Mill, Port St., Florida (Feb. 1990 to August 1990)
Project Manager: Fabricated & installed a piping system throughout the Pulp Mill for the collection of a poisonous gas, and to be delivered to the Lime Kilns for burning. Several old vessels & piping were demolished and new vessels installed without shutting the plant down. Coordinating our work with plant operations was a must as safety which had to be carefully monitored.

Fluor Constructors/Southeast University Fluidizing Bed Boiler, Cape Girardeau, Mo. (Feb.1988 to Nov. 1989)
Project Manager: Replaced existing boiler with an experimental Fluidizing Bed Boiler that included a new control room, bag house, pumps, compressors, piping, instrumentation, and a new roof on the existing building. All work was coordinated with the maintenance manager.

Fluor Constructors/ TVA, Shawnee Steam Plant Fluidizing Bed Boiler, Paducah, Ky. (April 1987to Feb. 1988).
Completion & Startup Manager: This was a joint venture between Flour Constructors, TVA, and Duke Power to install a new experimental Fluidizing Bed Boiler, Control room, Bag house, Compressors, Piping, Electrical conduit & wiring, and computer systems.

Ebasco/HP&L, South Texas Nuclear Plant, Bay City, Texas, (1985 & 1986)
Completion Manager: My responsibility was the completion all of mechanical & electrical systems that included the required testing, inspection & signed-off documentation. My position also included the supervision of all manual & non manual employees of our department.

Tompkins-Beckwith/ Daniels/CP&L, Shearon Harris Nuclear Plant, Raleigh, N.C.(1983-1985)
Completion General Superintendent: Responsible for the development of the mechanical testing program and the testing of the mechanical systems making sure all documents were complete with the sign-off of all documentation.

Tompkins-Beckwith/Ebasco/LP&L, Waterford III Nuclear Plant (1980-1983)
Completion & Startup Manager: This department consisted of Superintendents, Field Engineers, and craftsmen for the completion of all mechanical systems. That included all open items from turnover, and NCR’s, & FCR’s with signed-off documentation. The piping craft completed the testing of all piping systems with signed-off documentation. We completed all mechanical engineering change orders including the purchase of required materials and equipment. On some occasions we were required to use multi-craft personnel during our testing, and the completion of open items. Once all testing had been completed and the documentation in the vault we completed Cold Hydro and Hot Functional testing with the support of Ebasco’s Start-up Group. My most important function was enforcing job and safety rules while protecting permanent equipment.

McCartin, McAuliffe Mechanical Contractor/Illinois Power, Clinton Nuclear Power Plant,
(1978-1979)
Mechanical Superintendent: This project was a two shift operations whereas I covered the second shift with multi-crafts doing rollover work from the day shift. We covered Piping, hangers, condenser tubes, structural steel, and scaffolding while maintaining our documentation, enforcing Job and Safety rules.

Daniels Construction/ Kansas City Power & Light/ Wolf Creek Nuclear Plant (1977-1978)
Containment Piping Superintendent: The plant was in its infancy, and we were bringing the vessel out of the ground. Our task was to install embedded piping, and pipe sleeves ahead of concrete pours. Testing was required for embedded pipe joints. Planning was essential at this stage of construction as well as the enforcement of Job & safety rules.

Daniels/Bechtel/Alabama Power, Farley Nuclear Plant (1973-1976)
Piping Superintendent/ Start-up Superintendent: In the beginning my crews were installing small & large bore pipe, and later advancing to hangers, struts, & supports. Then moving on to instrumentation throughout the plant. In 1974 we moved into flushing & testing of all piping & equipment in the plant & yard.
In our early we had to learn how to document our work in the prepared “work packages”. We also had to work safely, and abide by Safety procedures, and Job rules. OSHA was new at the time which gave us new dimensions of safety. Our performance progressed and we moved on to Cold Hydro, and Hot functional testing with the support of Start-up group. A short time later Farley Nuclear Unit #1 was put on line.

Prior to 1973 and between management assignments today, I work and have worked as a craftsman on numerous projects throughout the United States. The Nuclear Plant “Outages” and “Shutdowns” on Paper Mills, Fossil Fuel Power Plants, Chemical Plants, and Refinery have been omitted due to the lack of spacing on resume.

Title : Charcoal Concrete
Description: Charcoal concrete containing charcoal is an example of construction material in harmony with this concept, where by sustainable construction development is useful with satisfactory performance, in both service and safety of structure, at lower costs and with advantages over ordinary concrete. Title : Vibration Analysis on Structural Component Description: The vibration analysis on structural components using virtual instrument is important in which resonance vibrations are measured. This vibration data is used to identify the beam’s fundamental mode of vibration. Tri-axial accelerometer will be used to measure and LabVIEW is used to record the vibrations of structural components. In this project an experimental analysis will be carried out by creating a prototype model of the beam. The design specification is used as per IS456-2000. The prototype model of beam prepared in laboratory is subjected to resonance vibration by using vibration system. Obtained results are logged in LabVIEW software. The measured vibration data will be subjected to FFT analysis and the results are to be interpreted with real time project for obtaining load carrying capacity of structure.

Work history

Accraply Inc.
Field service engineer
**-** ** *******

While at Accraply I have done multiple jobs.
The first 6 years was strictly traveling to customer plants and repairing machines, adding upgrades, training and setup.
I went to the production floor for a year, still made gold in airline status. Preferred the traveling and service aspect of the job a lot more.
Back to service for 3 years traveling full time.
For the last 10 years I travel some but took over the phone support and scheduling of the service techs. This makes me the one the techs are calling from the field for support. This is a lot harder than troubleshooting the equipment. Trying to get the customer to see what you are referring too and get proper feedback on what the machine is doing from the customer can be difficult.

Tasks;
Phone support,
installation of new machine and upgrades,
training and repair of automated labeling machines.

Skills;
Plc programming mainly Allen Bradley,
Mechanical modification of machine, as a tech I do what it takes to get up and running
Electrical and mechanical troubleshooting, I have a degree in electronics but am quite mechanical as well.
I think on my feet, of the techs working for Accraply I can say that I think on my feet and want to fix the machine without help, if at all possible, from anyone else. Some techs are not like that, they want me or engineering to make all the decisions for them.

Negatives, every tech has both positive and negative attributes. Putting the right tech on the right job can be hard, here are mine.
I am a not the best trainer, my problem is I know multiple ways to do things and when I train I tell them the various ways. I tell the customer to use a way that works for them. This is bad because a lot of customers only want to hear one way to do a task.
I do not like training large groups. I get nervous if there are too many people watching me. I have trained up to 40 people in a class room before but I prefer 1 to 5 people at the machine. I could never be a public speaker.
My desk is a mess, although I know where everything is and it is a revolving mess.
I am a programmer and can do board level repair but I am not an engineering level programmer. I make changes as needed for production and upgrades but have never started a program from scratch.
When I make modifications, I tend to look at what I have on hand and how to make that work, rather than the best way to do it and what materials we need to get.

To Whom It May Concern,
I am an experienced Mac administrator located in Fairfax, VA. With over 18 years working directly for Apple, I have an intimate knowledge of macOS and iOS support. For the past three years, I have been the Lead IT Support Specialist and Mac Engineer at a prestigious private school, responsible for maintaining and deploying a ﬂeet of 1200 Apple devices, and resolving support tickets from students, faculty, and staff. I am also Jamf certiﬁed in both the 200 and 300 levels, and have experience administering G Suite for education, and managing user access leveraging Active Directory. Currently, I am looking for a chance to develop my career and grow my skills. While I have learned a lot in my current role, I’m interested in the opportunity that The Motley Fool has to offer. I have heard a lot about the unique culture there, and the job description on your website shows a lot of ability for innovation, automation, and improvement. With my past Mac management experience and top notch customer service training, I think I would be a strong member of your tier two support team. I’m looking forward to ﬁnding out if I’m a match for this position. Thanks,

SUMMARY
I am a highly contributing employee who helps nourish a culture of teamwork and feedback among my peers.With over 18 years of experience working at Apple Inc., I have an intimate knowledge of Apple products and have integrated it with my passion for education. This has helped me greatly during my time as an IT Support Technician at Flint Hill School. I have a thirst for knowledge and learning about the latest tech which is the reason I still work for Apple part time. At Flint Hill I have many responsibilities ranging from troubleshooting software, repairing Macs, controlling content on the network through the web ﬁlter, and managing devices using Jamf Pro’s MDM solution. I am part of the team that manages and supports the One-to-One program for the Macs and iPads. Primarily, my time is spent planning for purchases, supervising device distribution, and facilitating the roll out of new technology through Apple DEP and Apple School Manager. Along with that, I help ﬁnd solutions to problems and answers to questions pertaining to the program. I am currently testing, planning and ﬁnalizing the roll out of our Two-to-One program for the middle school, where each student will have both an iPad and a MacBook Air to use for their studies. At Apple I help direct, lead, and grow a very technical group of Mac Geniuses. I have comprehensive experience with sales ranging from individual consumer to large companies with the business team. I also have expertise in inventory management, leadership, and continued motivation and training of my peers. Throughout my time at Apple I have played a key role in launching, promoting and supporting world- changing products and services. As one of the original Apple retail employees, I had the privilege of going through highly specialized training for interacting with customers and facilitated in creating a credo that ties the customer’s needs as a ﬁlter for everything we do. I personally collaborated with Steve Jobs on ‘Project Nexus’; the planning and launch of Apple’s retail endeavor. As of today, Apple Retail is critical to their success and responsible for almost $100 billion dollars a year of net revenue; helping it become the world’s most valuable company. The training and on boarding process I have experienced leads me to ﬁrmly believe that when working with a customer, I’m not just providing service- it’s about giving each person an experience that will enrich their life. This has always proved beneﬁcial to me at creating rapport, establishing relationships and building trust with people of all ages. EXPERIENCE

With 28 years of experience in performing rigging duties, and extensive knowledge of rigging equipment and their capacities, I am just the right candidate for the position of a Rigger/ Ropesman. I am confident that I can provide your organization with the expertise that it needs from a person in this position.

As noted on Resume, I am highly skilled in inspecting all applicable rigging, planning for lifts using the weight of the load, and able to estimate the lifting capacity of the equipment. Moreover, I possess advanced transportation knowledge with regards to moving equipment and materials from one point to another, able to attach load through slings, chains, cables, hooks, shackles and other interconnected tools.

I have the ability to work as part of a team but I am also self-motivated with the ability to perform my duties independently. I have lots of patience and I pay close attention to detail so I notice the small things that can make a big difference if not handled correctly.
I have excellent communication skills, problem- solving abilities, great eyesight and I am physically able to meet the requirements of this demanding job.

VARISTOR IMPROVEMENT:
Description:
As the input filter circuit Vasritor component burnt issue in field side raised steeply after the NPD in the year 2018. During Root cause analysing we found that some of the varistor got burst at surge voltage of 500V. So we changed a part with 680V varistor with a withstanding voltage of about 1200V thereby protecting the circuit from high surge voltage.
Effect:
VOC for Varistor burnt got reduced from 9.81% 3.28% COIL DELETION ACTIVITY:
Description:
In SMPS Circuit we have coil choke purpose is to reduce the EMI/EMC level. As we are exporting some of the refrigerator to the regulated countries like Morocco & Tunisia. As far as domestic country like India Nepal and Sri Lanka which is not a EMI/EMC regulated country So we deleted EMI/EMC filter coils in the main PBA using Cadence allegro.
Effect:
A yearly cost saving of about 380K$ won.

Dear Sir,
Your job posting for a Human Resources Manager caught my attention because my HR management experience has been matching with what you are looking for, so I am familiar with the challenges. In addition to leading the HR department, I am a strategic business partner in my current position and serve on the executive team.
My 22 years in HR as regional manager, have allowed me to grow and develop professionally and as a leader.
You are seeking an individual with a strong passion to innovate and drive for solutions. Since I started the HR department from scratch in my current organization and have led the adoption of all people processes, systems, policies, and procedures, I qualify. Personal accountability for results and my integrity are respected and unquestioned. I established a performance development and career planning process that utilizes both internal and external development opportunities for employees including mentoring, job-shadowing, team leadership, and classes.
I am most anxious to join an organization where HR is respected and where I can continue to provide input to the strategic business issues while implementing forward thinking HR and talent management strategies. Your advertised position appears to fit my experience, accomplishments, and education.
I am anxious to contribute to a new organization with the same energy, creativity, and commitment that I have brought to my past positions. Looking for a chance to interview with your team,

Recommendations:

David Thatcher
Variable-cost based market entry and growth into the Middle East
October 19, 2015, David managed Rito directly

Rito was recruited to head-up a business development project in a venture with BP in the Philippines. He has a solid understanding of engineering principles, in particular, related to the oil and gas sector. What I found valuable while working with Rito is the good commercial acumen he possesses, and importantly, a calm nature and clear mind while working under pressure. I would recommend Rito for a role where commercial decision making within a technical industry in a segment that is going through change needs a solid and reliable decision maker to drive results.

Kim Dumagco
Retail Territory Manager at Shell
January 26, 2018, Kim reported directly to Rito

I consider working with Sir Rex as an important part of my early years in the sales industry, particularly in the Petroleum. Sir Rex became one of my line managers in Mawab. He handled five talented sales individuals including me. Coming from different multinational companies including Total, he brought a lot of Global standards to a local company when it comes to work ethic, values, disciplines, and performance. Sir Rex was definitely not just an experienced Manager but an asset to Mawab back then. As a Boss, he was very passionate in delivering performance and growth not just to the company but to all of his subordinates as well. He has very good skills in managing and handling people. In fact, I consider him as a people person with high capacity of a strategic thinker. His coaching skills add up to his list of his managerial competencies. He goes well with millennial and I think that is an advantage. Another good quality of Sir Rex is that he is data driven. He knows how to analyze and present data to his team and translate it to workable plan. And most of the time, his decisions were based on insights derived from data. Sir Rex has the right attitude and mindset of a good Manager/Boss. He can bring out the best in you if let him coach you and help you. Working with him helped me acquire necessary skills which I consider as part of my current knowledge and ability right now. As a produce of Sir Rex, I am now working for the single-biggest branded petroleum company in the world as a Retail Territory Manager, and I would not be able to reach this point if I did not met Sir Rex and became his subordinate. I recommend him to companies needing a valuable asset because I know he possess high capacity, experience, and potential.
