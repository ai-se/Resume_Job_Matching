Do you get energy from empowering people to do what they love? Do you want to work on cutting-edge technology that has the potential of changing the way people develop software? Come be a critical part of our lean, fast-moving, low-ego machine of a team.
About you. You are a scrappy, hungry, versatile software engineer looking for an opportunity to make your mark on the world. You love systems programming and are looking to make impact at a fast pace. You are looking to get obsessed with building something that will make people's lives better. Not only do the terms ""enterprise,"" ""security,"" and ""developer tools"" mean something to you, they also represent areas where you want to make meaningful contributions.
About the team. We are a stealth-mode company looking for a member of our founding team with nontrivial systems engineering experience. We have deep expertise in systems engineering, software analysis, and data privacy and are setting out to change how people work with data for the better. The technical sophistication of our offering will be a key differentiator, so we highly value good engineering!
About Akita. As companies collect more data, it's increasingly important for their success to get a handle on how that data is being used. Changes in consumer data regulation have made it especially important to make sure that data is not getting written places it is not supposed to go.
These trends have given us the rare opportunity to build a new kind of data tool that gives a level of visibility and control over data that did not previously exist. By giving visibility to information not previously surfaced by any tool, Akita allows engineering, security, compliance, and devops teams to focus on using their data, rather than tracking it down and not losing it. Our approach is based on a decade of research by founder and CEO Jean Yang's research at CMU and MIT.
We are a seed-stage company with the backing of two of the best VC firms in enterprise software, as well as a small number of incredible angel investors and advisors with deep experience in building companies and products. Our advisors include the co-inventor of autocorrect and the former CISO of a major public company.
We understand that this is not much information to go on, but we are happy to talk more openly in private about what we are doing!
Here is what you will work on:Systems programming. We're building a technically complex product that also needs to scale! There's going to be a good amount of old-fashioned systems programming that will need to do.Prototyping. Especially before we find product-market fit, we need to be prepared to iterate a lot over the refinements of the initial product thesis. You will build demos and prototype new features to help us evaluate both feasibility and technical interest.Technical R&D. We are working on cutting edge technology, some of which has not previously been deployed at scale in industry and some of which may even be beyond what is currently known to be possible. You will also be involved with technical R&D work.System design. We are building a metropolis of software from scratch! As we move features from prototypes into production-ready systems, we will need to be thoughtful about the tradeoffs we make as we design our systems.General scrappy activities. We've been doing everything from assembling our own furniture to setting up build environments. We're looking for someone who is excited about rolling up their sleeves and building from the ground up.
Experience:Bachelor's degree. We are looking for someone with a Computer Science education with a solid grasp of algorithms and data structures. Preferred coursework/comparable industry experience: Compilers, Operating Systems, and Distributed Systems. We're also happy to consider engineers who have not taken an academic path but who are strong on data structures and other CS fundamentals.Experience building from scratch. We're building our product from the ground up. We are looking for an engineer who is comfortable with the ambiguity of not having most of the system they are working on be fully defined or built. The ideal candidate has been involved in building at least one system from scratch.Experience building software that has been deployed. The ideal candidate has been involved in building at least one system that has seen substantial production use.Startup exposure. The ideal candidate understands the iteration involved in finding product-market fit.

Job Description
We are looking for software engineers to join the DevOps Community team at CyberArk! Our team delivers high-quality open source software and more to CyberArk’s customers.
We know that our community is best served when:
Our projects are active, maintained, well organized, and superbly documented
We discuss, plan, design, and build in the open
Contributions from community members are solicited, welcomed, and reviewed

Responsibilities
We are responsible for many features and initiatives within the CyberArk portfolio, including:

Features within the Conjur open source product
Integrations for the Conjur and DAP products with popular open DevOps tools
Connectors and enhancements for the revolutionary Secretless Broker
APIs and SDKs for the above

Our engineers work on a wide variety of projects, from integrations with cutting-edge DevOps tools to moonshot projects that seek to revolutionize the world of DevOps security. Our primary product is a secrets vault and privilege engine, built upon our open source core.

What kinds of things would you work on?

We know that if you're a professional engineer, experience with specific tools or languages can usually be picked up quickly. That said, engineers on our team are using the following tools on an almost daily basis:

Golang, Ruby, Python, and JS...at a minimum. This is a polyglot position!
Docker, GitHub, Jenkins, GitLab
Kubernetes, OpenShift, Cloud Foundry
AWS, Azure, GCP
Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Terraform

Responsibilities

Would you succeed on our team?
If a good number of the following apply to you, there’s a high chance that you’d be a fit for our team:

You write high-quality software
You know how to manage technical debt
You get end-to-end with solutions early in order to de-risk them
Feedback loops – especially with real customers – are a highly valued asset
The quality of product experience you create matters deeply to you
You enjoy attending industry conferences to learn (or even better, presenting at them)
You hold your colleagues to the same high standard as you do yourself
You already contribute to some open source software and communities
You love to quickly adopt new tools and languages
You understand the DevOps landscape
You are extremely good at writing

However, if you have a very non-typical engineering background and you think we should still consider you, we’d love to hear why. Diversity of perspectives and experiences are very important to us.

This position is located in Newton, MA.

Senior software engineer,
and ideally, this would be someone who can work in both the
mobile and web space.

The role initially will be mobile (which is the focus of the
job description), but will eventually move into a full stack
position which will require working in Go! and Ruby on Rails.

Required Experience:

At a minimum you must have at least 5 years of software engineer
experience. By that we don t mean 5 years of fiddling around as a
hobby. We mean daily experience designing and implementing code.

Having a college degree is important but if you don t have one
then be able to explain why not, we are an understanding group.

Solid OOD skills. Your experience needs to show you have the
ability to design and implement extensible and reusable software.

Experience with Objective-C. This means that you have written one
or more apps using it and that it s taken you at least a year to
write the app (or apps). If that is true then you better know how to
upload the app to Test Flight and understand the nuances or
certificates and provisioning.

Knowledge of what a Cocoa Pod is and how to create and use one.

Knowledge of MVC design pattern and other patterns (e.g., Singleton).

Experience with Xaramin. We know Xaramin hasn t been out for
decades but we require experience with it, including how to upload
an app to the App Store and the Google Play store using it.

Self-driven and focused. You must have the ability to work
remotely without your boss sitting next to you reminding you to turn
the TV off and to stop surfing the web.

Problem solver. Not afraid to solve complex problems and defend
your position. In other words, you have to be technical and be able
to determine which solution is the better solution.

Ability to write documentation. You ll need to understand grammar
and how to construct your thoughts into words that others can understand.

Have a tough skin. Others will review your design and work so
don t pout when they comment on it. Take comments in stride and
learn from them or teach others that their comment was incorrect.

Experience with Git. If you don t know what Git is then take a few
days or a week and get experience.

Experience with macOS and iOS. If you don t have this then you may
not want to apply because we use Apple computers (for better or
worse) as our development machines.

Experience seeing risks in a schedule and knowing when to speak up.

Experience meeting deadlines and not being afraid to but in extra
time during high pressure parts of the project. We understand that
there is more to life than work but we also have to create products
to stay in business which means we have schedules and deadlines. If
you are afraid to push hard during crunch time then this may not be
the place for you.

Preferred Experience:

Experience with encryption on iOS and Android.

Experience with human factors and good UI practices.

Experience with designing and implementing custom UI controls on
iOS and Android.

Experience with data validation and why it is a necessary in any
design, not just good designs.

Experience with client/server design and implementation.

Senior software engineer, and ideally, this would be someone who can work in both the mobile and web space.
The role initially will be mobile (which is the focus of the job description), but will eventually move into a full stack position which will require working in Go! and Ruby on Rails.

Required Experience:

At a minimum you must have at least 5 years of software engineer experience. By that we don t mean 5 years of fiddling around as a hobby. We mean daily experience designing and implementing code.
Having a college degree is important but if you don t have one then be able to explain why not, we are an understanding group.
Solid OOD skills. Your experience needs to show you have the ability to design and implement extensible and reusable software.
Experience with Objective-C. This means that you have written one or more apps using it and that it s taken you at least a year to write the app (or apps). If that is true then you better know how to upload the app to Test Flight and understand the nuances or certificates and provisioning.
Knowledge of what a Cocoa Pod is and how to create and use one.
Knowledge of MVC design pattern and other patterns (e.g., Singleton).
Experience with Xaramin. We know Xaramin hasn t been out for decades but we require experience with it, including how to upload an app to the App Store and the Google Play store using it.
Self-driven and focused. You must have the ability to work remotely without your boss sitting next to you reminding you to turn the TV off and to stop surfing the web.
Problem solver. Not afraid to solve complex problems and defend your position. In other words, you have to be technical and be able to determine which solution is the better solution.
Ability to write documentation. You ll need to understand grammar and how to construct your thoughts into words that others can understand.
Have a tough skin. Others will review your design and work so don t pout when they comment on it. Take comments in stride and learn from them or teach others that their comment was incorrect.
Experience with Git. If you don t know what Git is then take a few days or a week and get experience.
Experience with macOS and iOS. If you don t have this then you may not want to apply because we use Apple computers (for better or worse) as our development machines.
Experience seeing risks in a schedule and knowing when to speak up.
Experience meeting deadlines and not being afraid to but in extra time during high pressure parts of the project. We understand that there is more to life than work but we also have to create products to stay in business which means we have schedules and deadlines. If you are afraid to push hard during crunch time then this may not be the place for you.
Preferred Experience:

Experience with encryption on iOS and Android.
Experience with human factors and good UI practices.
Experience with designing and implementing custom UI controls on iOS and Android.
Experience with data validation and why it is a necessary in any design, not just good designs.

We have been working with a handful of talented external UI/UX and visual designers for our alpha product and are now looking for our first in-house designer.About Akita.
As companies collect more data, its increasingly important for their success to get a handle on how that data is being used.
Changes in consumer data regulation have made it especially important to make sure that data is not getting written places it is not supposed to go.These trends have given us the rare opportunity to build a new kind of data tool that gives a level of visibility and control over data that did not previously exist.
By giving visibility to information not previously surfaced by any tool, Akita allows engineering, security, compliance, and devops teams to focus on using their data, rather than tracking it down and not losing it.
Our approach is based on a decade of research by founder and CEO Jean Yang's research at CMU and MIT.We are a seed-stage company with the backing of two of the best VC firms in enterprise software, as well as a small number of incredible angel investors and advisors with deep experience in building companies and products.
Our advisors include the co-inventor of autocorrect and the former CISO of a major public company.We understand that this is not much information to go on, but we are happy to talk more openly in private about what we are doing!Here is what you will work on:Product design.

You will be working with the CEO and product team to recruit, design, and conduct user research interviews with security engineering teams, directors, and CISOs to validate product directions and designs.Branding.

You will work closely with the CEO on developing an iconic brand for Akita.Marketing materials.
You will work closely with the CEO to create internal and external presentations, pitch decks, fliers, and other materials.General scrappy activities.
Weve been doing everything from assembling our own furniture to setting up build environments.

We are looking for someone with 5+ years of design experience.Experience designing web applications.
The ideal candidate has previously worked on design for developer tools.Experience building from scratch.
Were building our product from the ground up.
We are looking for a designer who is comfortable with the ambiguity of not having most of the system they are working on be fully defined or built.
The ideal candidate has built at least one system from scratch that has been used by someone else.Startup exposure.
The ideal candidate understands the iteration involved in finding product-market fit.Akita is an equal-opportunity employer.
