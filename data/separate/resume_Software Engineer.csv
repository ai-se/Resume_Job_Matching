Ladle Slag Detection Project, AMEPA
Slag detection is a major process problem in steel making industry. Mixing slag with molten steel deteriorates the quality of the final product and destroys refractories. I have been assigned the task to install, commission and integrate AMEPA ladle slag detection system into continuous casting machine process control system. PLC and HMI programming has been done to integrate the system in our industrial automation network. Communication (PROFIBUS and Ethernet) has been established between slag detection system and process control network to exchange data. Project was a complete success. Operation was smooth. System integration was a success. We managed to exchange data and receive the status of the slag detection system during operation.

BAGHOUSE (Fume Treatment Plant) Optimization
Energy saving, is the BAGHOUSE Optimization project main target. To achieve this task, we are planning to automatically control the percentage of opening of Meltshop plant fume dampers, control the speeds of medium voltage suction motors and burn the dioxins and furans organic particles. I have been assigned the task of reviewing PLC programming, instrumentations’ and drawings of Consteel and Baghouse. Quenching tower area of the Consteel plant has been completely recommissioned, new sensors have been added, A lot of modifications have been made in Consteel and BAGHOUSE PLCs. Drawings have been reviewed and modified. It is still ongoing project.
Operating hot billets in billet conditioning machine
The main target is to be able to operate hot billets until it reaches the final inspection table. The main challenge is the very high temperature of the hot billets. It can reach up to 470OC. Such a temperature can easily destroy photo electric cells which define the exact location at which the billet will be stopped on the inspection roller table. We had to investigate the options for new types of sensor which can measure the distance of the approaching hot billet. Laser distance sensor has been employed. Laser beam comes out from the sensor and the reflection of it from the billet cross section of the hot billet defines the distance travelled by the billet on roller table. At a certain st-point billet is stopped.
New transformers integration into IVACO substation
Aging transformers, T1 & T2, are being replaced with new ones. The main challenge is to integrate the new transforms in the old substation. Drawings for the existing control, protection and paralleling circuits. Complete analysis of the existing system is being done. New interconnection drawings for connecting new transformers with substation will be created. Communication between transformers’ signals and load controller PLC will be established. Finally, commissioning and energizing will be done.

Grim:
The obligatory trade reporting of UK Gilts to London Stock Exchange is handled by an application called “Grim” within the Deutsche Bank infrastructure which receives the trade data from Trade Manager. The objective of the project is to define the business and legal requirements on UK Gilts primary market deals which need to be excluded from the Gilt trade reporting to the London Stock Exchange through the GRIM application. The reporting should exclude all primary market deals done the 1st tranche of a new issue or any other following tranches (tap) as well as our purchases between Deutsche Bank and other market makers, since only the seller is obliged to report to London Stock Exchange. The existing logic in GRIM filters the above mentioned trades insufficiently and causes complaints addressed by the London Stock exchange to Deutsche Bank’s compliance team, creating the risk of fines being imposed by the regulator . Further to the suppression of primary market deals, trades with low trading volume should be reported. The current logic in GRIM is rounding down to zero and suppressing the trade reporting which causes an underreporting.

Order processing system is a complex software application which dealt with creation of Orders/placing the orders for the customers of AT&T with respect to the products or services provided by AT&T. This involved interfacing with lots of external systems for Billing, Provisioning, Status tracking, etc. The front end part, which implies the UI using which the order is placed, takes lots of processing after the order is placed by customer like Order Decomposition, where we decompose the Order and send it to appropriate systems for processing it( Ex: Billing, Provisioning etc ). This part of order decomposition is the centralized part of the whole application where all the processing starts from here. Interfacing with other systems was done using XML over HTTP. This was the basic way of communication where in we used to send XML request with respect to the business details which has to be sent to that system and wait for a response from it. Here there was a concept of synchronous and asynchronous where the response could be any of these, based on the system which is processing it. From architecture point of view, we had followed Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. But AT&T had their own implementation of this.

Dallas, TX 75240
Dear Sir,
I have been doing computer and network infrastructure support for many years, primarily in the SMB marketplace. While my focus has been on the entire enterprise from a technical perspective, from an entrepreneurial perspective I know what needs to be done across the entire infrastructure ……which can now, seamlessly extend to and include the ‘cloud’. Please understand this…I can walk into a shell of a building and completely install and setup the entire network including all the servers…and be responsible for that organization! I have enough understanding and resources that I can fully support and\or relocate an entire office and put it anywhere on the planet it needs to be.
I’ve gotten pretty resourceful and I know what works and especially, products and services that are reliable. I can think on my feet and work under pressure! I would like to make the transition back into corporate IT and/or management and feel I have a lot of experience and intellect to offer, especially with all the experience I’ve gained I know what to watch out for. Since I do have a lot of firsthand experience, I know all the industry related nuances. Please give me a call either way. I have a very diverse background with a lot of experience in many areas including DFARS, NIST 800-171 and SCIF related standards. I can do what you’re asking for…and very likely, more! Look forward to meeting you.
Thanks,
Rick McClure

Project:
Academic Project:
AN IMPROVED PIXEL SIEVE METHOD FOR VISUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY. In this project an improved version of pixel sieve method is proposed. For this purpose, the utility of current pixel sieve method has been examined. The examinations of current pixel sieve method suggest that an improved pixel sieve method can be projected. Therefore, an attempt is made in this project to present a projected method which could be best applied.
Responsibilities:
• Based on cross merge and key shifting schemes, we iterate the sieve and cross merge method several times with different shifted keys on the original image.
• Pixel Sieve method was proposed recently to encode an image into shares, but the encryption quality is poor. In this project an improved version of pixel sieve method is proposed to achieve more security than existing pixel sieve method. Project 2:

List of the projects practiced during the Data Analyst training:
Python projects:
1. Iris Dataset:
This data set consists of the physical parameters of three species of flower — Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica.
In this data we will be predicting the classes of the flowers based on numeric parameters that are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length.
NumPy, Pandas and Scikit Learn are some of the inbuilt libraries in Python that we have used.
Using algorithms, we have trained our model to check how accurate every algorithm
K – Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logical Regression,
Random forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine)
Here, Random forest gives optimal accuracy compared to others
By using this we reduce the chances of overfitting and variance in the data which thus lead to better accuracy
2. House Price Prediction:
Thousands of houses are sold every day. There are some questions every buyer asks himself like: What is the actual price that this house
This data contains 1460 training data points & 80 features that might help us predict the selling price of a house.
To apply data preprocessing and preparation
techniques
Exploratory data analysis allows us to understand the data and the relationships between variables
better
Correlation between variables helps us to predictor variables are correlated with the target variable
Build machine learning models able to predict house price based on Algorithms: - Linear Regression,
Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression,
Decision Tress, Neural Networks, Random Forest
Choose an algorithm that implements the
corresponding technique
To analyze and compare models’ performance in
order to choose the best model
R projects:
1. Movie Recommendation System:
To build a recommendation engine that
recommends movies to users
A recommendation system provides suggestions to
the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history.
In our Data Science project, we will make use of these four packages – ‘recommenderlab’,
‘ggplot2’, ‘data.table’ and ‘reshape2’.
Data pre-Processing will help to make the finalized dataset to build the model by using One-hot encoding
We will implement a single model– Item Based
Collaborative Filtering.
Explore the most viewed movies in our dataset
Data Normalization is a data preparation procedure to standardize the numerical values in a column to a
common scale value
The algorithm first builds a similar-items table of the customers who have purchased them into a
combination of similar items. This is then fed into the recommendation system

EXPERIENCE:

7/2015 – current Barclays Bank NYC/NJ Senior Java Lead
CCAR-Orchestration and Monitoring.
As Java lead, architected and designed CCAR-ONM (Orchestration and Monitoring) core component, JBPM based workflow engine, CCARWFT (Workflow Tool)
It takes advantage of JBPM 6 as workflow engine, to orchestrate the whole CCAR process, such as Scenario Manager tool(SMT), model execution process/Risk calc/Quan(MEF), ETL, market data curve(MOSS), risk weighed asset(RWA), equities, and so on for actual data as well as risk calculators for projection data.
Designed/implemented 4 major productivity features which are greatly enhanced jbpm processes.
oParallel executions of sub-processes,
oRe-run functionality, which allows the process to be retriggered from which it was failed. This has been a great productivity feature for users running the CCAR projection runs.
oForce fail feature, which allows user to fail the previously run process at any desired subprocess and rerun from there onward.
oIcing/skipping tasks, which provides configuration to skip any activities. This has greatly increased the versatility of the system.
The system is designed to be loosely coupled with all the orchestrated systems either via REST web service call with JSON payload or Solace based message in terms of XML structure. To overcome the three layer limitation of JBPM process modelling, a process tree concept was introduced to accommodate multiple-level processes so that the framework is extensive vertically as well as horizontally. JBPM/SPRING MVC/REST/XML
Implemented the CCARWFT workflow execution framework which executes each JBPM process via configurations in Spring config file. Addition of a new jbpm process is realized by extending a base work item handler class and customizing it besides the configuration work. This greatly increased the productivity of programmers and enhanced the reliability of the system. Another important feature is that the execution of a jbpm process can be launched either by REST web service call or by a Solace message or combination of both.
Implemented process tree structure which allows to execute multiple-layer processes and to re-start message triggered process with capability of skipped already run processes.
Designed the common context JSON format for REST web service call and XML message schema. Implemented generic trigger message construction and message handler. Implemented many REST APIs for UI code to initiate, control and display end to end processes.

5/2014 – 6/2015 Citi Risk Citi Group, Warren NJ Senior Software Consultant
CCAR-PPNR-Ruby Integration. Designed and implemented SEC mandated CCAR submission core component - on demand PPNR-Ruby integration to fetch net interest revenue data from Citi risk engine, Ruby, to PPNR presentation tool which allows users to review and modify the value as needed. The challenge is to design the request/response to map Citi’s three hierarchies (managed segment, managed geography, and legal entity) of organization structure to SEC aligned line items such as revenue, expense, etc. The system is designed as layered structures (construction of request, http/rest, response processing/error handling, and cache updating) so that intermediate data can be stored in staging table for audit and debugging. Another benefit is that the components can be reused for different ways of fetch data. The robust error handling scheme has user always informed. The system has enable Citi to have successfully passed the CCAR test for 2014. It is implemented using Java1.7/Spring MVC/Hibernate/Rest web service/Jason/Oracle/TibcoRV/Websphere/Linux
Lead design and Implementation of three more ways to fetch Ruby data. a). Spring/Quartz scheduler to fetch Ruby data according to predefined cron expression which can be easily configured in database; b) Blocking queue based Master Ruby Live sync to allow user to select the combination of scenarios and planning units; c) Custom schedule table to allow other program to fill in the schedule to trigger the sync process. Java1.7/Spring MVC/Quartz/ Hibernate/Multithread /Websphere/Oracle
Rewritten fast reload of PPNR cache. In startup, the existing PPNR program needs approximately an hour to load all the data to cache. The investigation reveals that the sql statement transposes more than a quarter millions of data points before returning to java calling routine. The solution is to break it up to fetch line item id data and line item value data separately and combine them together in the java program, resulting in over 80% of reduction of loading time. It needs only 9 mins to start up now. Moreover, the fast reload component is being used by template loader process to load data into PPNR cache without restarting the server. Java1.7/Multithread/Oracle/Websphere
Re-designed one level lock to two level locks mechanism to accommodate submission workflow required lock and user activities/process coordination lock. This has provided the guarantee of integrity of the data being modified and significantly reduced the error due to the contention of various processes. Core/Java1.7/Concurrent/PL/SQL
Wrote Jade upload program to parse and load excel file to PPNR using Apache POI lib. Java/Apache POI lib;

2/2012 – 3/2014 Interactive Data, NYC Senior Software Engineer
Athena Email Data Extraction. Hired when this project was 7 months delay due to deficient design and non functioning partial implementation. Taken lead role in abstracting some of the customized business rules to a plugin component which interacts with the UI logic as opposed to implement every business rule in a separate workflow node. This greatly reduced the complexity of the project, made the debugging of the system much easier, and leaped forward the project much closer to the finish line. Worked closely with a coworker and business analyst, configured, customized, and setup Autonomy’s IDOL (intelligent data operating layer) and Scrittura (workflow), delivered the functioning project to production in 6 months successfully. This value added service has freed 10 resources which has been diligently manually copying and pasting the fixed income data from emails. The data delivery time was reduced to 10 mins from 2 hours. Distributed architecture/Weblogic 10.3.6/Spring Core/Oracle
Designed generic xml output data schema and implemented the file generation/distribution component using JAXB technology and in house DCsend technology
Customized Lua script in the CFS component to identify each individual mailbox
Developed bulk ignore functionality to allow user to ignore those emails not interested as whole. Jsp.
Customized Template Build/Deploy Script. Autonomy’s IDOL utilized regex based template to define how to extract the structured or semi-structured data in the email. This dictates that each structure needs a template, resulting in thousands of them. These have to be manually entered into the config file of IndexTask components. It is error prone. A customized template build perl script was developed to automate this process. The script builds for each asset class respectively. Deployment of newly developed template becomes a weekly routine.
Integration Test Framework. The issue encountered when working with template/rule based system is that when template/rule being changed/updated, it affects every data it applied to in the scope. This can not be substituted by unit test. Furthermore, the rule conflicts may produce unpredictable result. To quantify the effects, large volume of data (about 45 thousands of files with size of around 10k) needs to be tested before and after the changes. Due to the in efficiency of the existing fully differing routine, efficient file comparison algorithms were developed for key-value pair based files and xml files respectively. Normally, the output files from the production code base will be used as baseline files to which the files from updated code base will compare. This has saved QA resources ( 6 resources for 3 days each needed for each iteration). This has warranted us every deployment successful in the last two years. Implemented in Java 1.7/Spring Core/Spring Annotation
Email Move and Caching Component. One of the important features in the email workflow is that the email URL needed to be cached so that the UI component can access it thread safe regardless of it being moved from Inbox to other folders. The cache not only will be accessed by different threads for the same section of the code but also different part of the code in the workflow. This was implemented using open source lib ehcache taking advantage of its acquire/releaseWriteLockOnkey(key) method to maximize performance and guaranteed thread safe. Java1.6/weblogic/Spring Core/Spring Annotation/JProfiler
Athena Monitoring Framework. Athena is a distributed system with many components. The present design consists of the following components. a). A heart beat (test email) based probe; b). An event-driven monitor and listener structure to collect data and handle the data accordingly such as sending out email alerts. The monitor will be a class implementing runnable interface with listener as one of the parameter in the constructor. Each monitor will run in its own thread launched by exectorService. Monitors can be dependency injected from a config file. c). The monitors will be controlled by the JMX Mbean based resource which exposes start monitor, stop monitor, query of monitor to JMX agent. The out of box JConsole was used to query/control the monitors. 4 Apache Common IO log file tailers have been implemented for ExchangeConntor, CFS, DIH, and IndexTask logs successfully. Java1.6/JMX
Prototyping of using Drools framework. Wrote a proof of concept application to demonstration of the feasibility of using open source Drools rule-based framework for replacing the Scrittura workflow engine.

2/2010 – 12/2011 Bloomberg, NJ Senior Software Consultant
Data Extraction Framework. OO designed the framework as extensible to accommodate three kinds of extraction engines, Boolean engine for pdf document, Html engine for html document, and third party engine adapter. Designed and implemented core part of Html data extraction engine. It was designed as layered structure of extraction, rule-based identification and mapping, and output transformation. Each layer can be extended laterally to accommodate the customization of specific processing logic. Also the sub-layers can exist within each layer. The main advantage is to allow the framework to be extended as business dictates. Another feature owes to the use of db table based rule engine which allows users to create/test rules. The framework cuts down the data to client time to 2 mins from 4 hours as required by the manually data picking in the outsourced business mode. Java6/J2EE/Apache/Jboss/Oracle 11/JProfiler.
Designed and modeled the HTML table as ExtrTable, ExtrRow, and ExtrCell structure with each bigger one enclosing a list of smaller structures with properties as attributes(fields). This makes the program easy to work with and data encapsulated.
Ternary search algorithm for strings was employed to maximize the performance of mapping list of string stems to a label. This is paramount for data mapping since every row of data involves this operation.
Proposed and implemented table type identification algorithm by taking advantage of the title offset relative to the beginning tag of the table and rules expressed in regular expression. This reduced the process time by 80%.
Autoprocess Test framework. Researched and identified the offset of the Html <table> tag within a document as unique identifier to the extracted tables. Established differential methodology of comparing the results of current run to a baseline so that any change caused by generic rule modification or program logic can be identified right way. It can be run routinely to guarantee the correctness of the result. Wrote multithread http clients with multiple file attachments to load test the Extraction Framework. Developed reports of incremental difference and performance via jsp pages.

Large Volume Data Processing.
Devised a methodology of loading/parsing ultra large vendor provided zipped real estate data file with size of more than 13G. First, write sqlloader scripts to load the file of size > 13 G to a staging table with 623 columns. Secondly, based on configured tables of desired fields and desired companies, a generated sql was used to output the query to a csv file for acquisition to pick up.
Implemented a table based rule engine to normalize address and map the vendor field names to Bloomberg internal name. The rule syntax follows the pattern of LHS, operator, RHS, and action. The defined operators are such as “contains”, “endwith”, “beginwith” and so on. This simple engine greatly enhanced the processing probability of filtering out the unnecessary info while allowing maximum performance (Full fledge rule engine tends to have performance hit). The mapping function allows the users to configure corresponding fields manually without code change. It makes it generic and extensible. JAVA6/Oracle 11
Wrote multi-thread worker to process the records into existing Bloomberg db data structure. Optimized stored procedures to minimize the table lock by separating the updating function to a different worker.

5/2008 – 2/2010 Verizon wireless, NJ Senior Software Consultant
E-commerce project: Music On Demand (MOD). Using OO principle, developed MODs collection data model. Proposed abstract collection type as base type to be extended to accommodate simple type of music including single item track, ringtone, and ringback tone as well as complex type containing multiple items such as album, category, jukebox, and playlist. This lays the solid foundation for the success of the project. Oracle11g/Toad9.1
SMS Alert message framework. Designed and developed SMS based short messages framework to deliver marketing/transaction message to either Inbox or targeted applications for mobile devices and smartphones and as well as email notifications. It consists of Control Objet, Message Format Object, Transport, and Destination Endpoints. The end points are configurable as needed in db. The framework is easily extensible to accommodate new type of message format via simply constructing a new message type and configure the end points. Another feature is its configurable retrying logic. It allows the messages to be resent at predefined intervals if the previous trial failed due to network/system issues. The maximum number of retry is also configurable. Finally, it is multithreaded on a single instance and fully distributable among instances on different servers. This is a revenue generating tool for the project. JAVA5/Quartz/PLSQL/Websphere7.0/RAD7
Designed and implemented 3 major servlet based MOD APIs: SendGifts, FindOthersInterest, and GetAlertContent. It involved converting XML input messages to/from JAXB objects, calling stored procedures in Oracle, and constructing/grouping data from db to desired XML responses. To enhance performance, dynamic sql in Oracle’s PL/SQL was extensively used to cache intermediate results to minimize network round trips. Exceptions are appropriately handled inside the stored procedure and corresponding error code and description are being passed back to the calling function. JAVA5/SessionBean/JAXB1.0/JDBC/PL/SQL11g/Websphere7.0/RAD7/JProfiler
Managed MOD in/out data feed development. Worked with business analyst to take requirement and designed and implemented with other developer the in/out data feeds via calling stateless session bean running on Websphere 7.0 to fetch leader board and discount code data from external vendor and send client credit to it. The incoming data was first cleaned up. Bad data will be filtered into an error table for further investigation. For leader board processing, the java/sql components was written such that new items was inserted into the catalog, existing ones to be updated, and stales to be deleted. The best point is that the script is self-maintaining the data integrity. Wrote Korn shell script to run this app as standalone java app. Java5/EJB/JDBC/PL/SQL/Shell Script./RAD7
Managed MOD compression layer enhancement and integrating test. Worked with business analyst to translate requirement to concrete design. Designed end-to-end integration testing strategy for QA group to execute. Coordinated with other developers, QA, middleware, network, and dba to resolve the issues arising from the test. Proposed to use static variable in log4j to bypass evaluating expensive string arguments. As a result, the compression layer response time is reduced from 3- 8 seconds to 40-80 milliseconds. Added a configurable connection pooling to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections to LDAP authentication server using singleton pattern.

10/2006 – 2/2008 Morgan Stanley, NY Prime Brokerage, Senior Software Engineer
Developed new custom cusip hedging functionality. This is a major enhancement to the existing hedging capability in Margin Schedule Calculator (MSC) in a Realtime Margin Trading System (RTM) of Prime Brokerage business. It is a business-enabling technology. This provides users with four new functionalities: a). Allow user to specify two cusips to hedge each other. b) When assigned priority, the order of hedging is guaranteed. c). Allow user to disable a particular hedging strategy at account level. d). As an added benefit, it allows the user to construct a portfolio and test through RTM. It is implemented in Java 1.5 running on Linux using Eclipse IDE/Ant/XML
Developed a new hedging engine based on EPIX ID (same issuer, but different cusips). This technology doubles the capacity of the hedging strategies offered by Morgan Stanley to hedge fund clients. It opened new means for clients to managing their risk and for Morgan Stanley to better compute margin requirements.
Convert old hedging strategies to new way of hedging. The strategies involved are spread, covered call, straddle, three way synthetic hedging, CDS/CDS, married put, hedging between ASCOT, CB and EQTY.
Renovation and globally synchronizing of MSC, Calc Manager, Risk-based margin calculators. This involves merging and unifying various versions of code base to a single one and test them to make sure that no functionality is left out.

The GAS KIT FOR TWO WHEELER Mechanical Mini Project has focused on the use of fuel in two stroke Gasoline engine. The goal of the project is to utilize non-conventional fuel and conventional fuel that has become expensive and insufficient today. This has resulted in less air pollution than conventional fuels which is better based on considerations of economic.
We have used LPG fuel system, two stroke vehicle, gasoline, and LPG in this project. LPG includes the adjustable regulator from storage tank with the transfer of valve present in the LPG cylinder.
LPG is abbreviated as Liquefied Petroleum Gas which is also known as bottled gas (or) Refinery gas. This is formed like a byproduct on bashing heavy crude oils or natural gas. The LPG is produced by bashing or dehydration of CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), desulphurised, or organic sulphide (Mercaptans).
2)Multi Nut Remover

Multi nut remover is a kit invented to reduce the effort and time in replacing the wheels of the vehicle. The plurality of lug nuts can be removed at one time without the usage of an electric motor or any hydraulic and pneumatic devices. The planetary shafts are arranged exactly in the pitch circle position of the lug nuts. This method can be used to remove any number of lug nuts but the design of gear varies according to the certain parameters like number of lug nuts, pitch circle diameter.
3)Design and optimization of Piston using ANSYS and CATIA software
Design, Analysis and optimization of piston which is stronger, lighter with minimum cost and with less time. Since the design and weight of the piston influence the engine performance. Study Design: Analysis of the stress distribution in the various parts of the piston to know the stresses due to the gas pressure and thermal variations using with Ansys. Methodology: The Piston of an engine is designed, analyzed and optimized by using graphics software. The CATIA V5R16, CAD software for performing the design phase and ANSYS 11.0 for analysis and optimization phases are used.

Employment & Personal Projects

Oct 17 – Aug 19
Beijer Electronics (Malmö, Sweden) – Software Development Engineer

At Beijer, our team had 2 core responsibilities as we developed our IioT platform: 1) Our dashboard product - a customizable web app for visualizing data transmitted though Azure from IoT devices on factory floors in remote locations. 2) The services, APIs and infrastructure to handle data transmission to/from Azure, licensing and user/device/data management.

Tech Stack: .Net Core, EmberJs, Qunit, SASS, xUnit, NSubstitute, TeamCity, Azure Functions, Azure IoT Hub

Specific Achievements:
• Built microservices which allowed us to create and enforce licensing, and accept or reject telemetry data from factory devices based on the validity of a device’s license.
• Developed a real-time, animated chart, which displayed live values for multiple data points received from Azure through a WebSocket connection. Featured smooth scrolling as the user-specified time interval elapsed.
Was our most popular data-display graphic on the dashboard product during beta-testing, based on customer feedback.
• Helped increase code coverage of the entire JavaScript code base from 40 to 70% during Summer 2018.
• Collaborated with another teammate to create the Azure function apps to handle the processing of incoming telemetry data from IoT devices so that it could be stored in Azure Blob Storage, ready for later use whenever a dashboard project was loaded and subsequently requested the latest telemetry, or a historical record of past data.
This allowed us to move away from mocking the main function or selling point of our product, and set it up legitimately so that it could now be monetized in production, with real customers.
• Led the creation of a web API to manage dashboard projects on an organizational and user level. According to feedback from 20 surveyed beta-customers, this made them feel safer about using the product, as they no longer needed to bookmark links, and they were no longer worried that unauthorized users could access their dashboard if they obtained a link in dishonest circumstances..

Sep 16 – May 17
Fastcom Telecom (Sligo, Ireland) – Technical Support Engineer Fastcom provides network traffic monitoring for businesses and internet for residential customers.

Tech Stack: JavaScript, Java

Specific Achievements:
• Developed a script which notified specified admin(s) whenever a device on a business’ network attempted to communicate outward to a known blacklisted IP address.
• Through being proactive and regularly checking in with customers, was able to learn about and address customer issues before they became critical. 6 customers called or wrote to say that it was a key factor in them deciding to stay, saving the company $4000 in 2016-17.
• 85% of 300 surveyed customers said they preferred dealing with our tech support team, than that of any other competitor they have previously been a customer with. It’s worth noting we were a 3-person team.

Mar 15 – Aug 15
Fastcom Telecom (Sligo, Ireland) – Web Developer Internship Tech Stack: Java, JavaScript, D3JS, CSS

Specific Achievements:
• Built a self-updating system of known blacklisted IP addresses.
• Built a system which would connect to different remote towers via SSH, run shell commands to record various network-related info, then be used to create email alerts for business customers.
• Built a system which analyses outgoing traffic to known blacklisted IPs and builds a graphic from that data to allow for easy identification of the most severe threats to the system. Proved useful for many of our business clients who we provided internal network monitoring to.
• Created an email alert system so that admins and other relevant bodies were informed of blacklist hits on the network in a timely, effective manner.

ACADEMIC PROJECT UNDERTAKEN
Project Name: Securing Online Reputation System
Environment: Windows XP/7, Java/J2EE
Project Description:
Combining mobile platforms such as manned or unmanned vehicles and peer-assisted wireless communication is an enabler for a vast number of applications. Routing packets in fully connected mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has been studied to a great extent, but the assumption on full connectivity is generally not valid in a real system. This case means that a practical routing protocol must handle intermittent connectivity and the absence of end-to-end connections. In this system we propose a geographical routing algorithm called location-aware routing for delay-tolerant networks (LAROD), enhanced with a location service, location dissemination service (LoDiS), which together are shown to suit an intermittently connected MANET (IC-MANET).

Project – x-MDN
Company: Global Logic India Ltd.
Designation/Role: BigData Developer
Brief: Whenever a mobile device connects to the internet, it is assigned a public IP and correspondingly a pilot packet is generated which is received by collector and it writes record to Kafka. Our system keeps on reading data from Kafka, process each session activity through Spark and update Redis DB accordingly. That is, if a pilot packet allocation record is received then the GIM makes an entry in redis for that particular activity, and when a de-allocation record is received then it removes the corresponding entry from redis. In this way GIM maintains a subscriber base in Redis for all the active connections.

Now whenever the device makes a request for Authentication, the request is interrupted by GSX and get details of the subscriber who has made this request from redis and authenticate device.
My key responsibilities are:
• Continuously reading device data from kafka through spark.
• Filter and parse invalid IP records.
• Validate IPV6 and IPV4 entry.
• Process each session activity and analyze it.
• Store each session activity in redis.

Projects Involvement in:
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as a Secondary fuel in 4 stroke SI engine.
The current scenario of petroleum products is too low and it may be exhausted within few years, after that we cannot thrown petrol vehicles to scrap, instead of petrol we can utilise the LPG as a fuel and we will get maximum benefits like good mileage, eco-friendly, cost reduction by small changing in the engine alteration by minimum investments.
The overall conclusion is, good mileage. Pollution reduction, and minimum investments and engine condition is good and proved by maintaining the related documents.

Generation of electricity from solar thermal copper tube water heater.
In solar water heater system, the generated hot water is stored in the insulated tank of temperature nearly 90 degrees, but for human comfortness and domestic application purpose we can utilise the hot water up to 50 degrees, remaining high temperature of water is stored in the tank means lot of drawbacks occurring. To avoids all these problems by using thermoelectric modules which converts the hot energy into electric pulses, and it can be stored and utilise for lightning purposes.

Production of Biodiesel from rice bran seeds.
The cultivated paddy can be utilised for the production of biodiesel by involving number of stages of breakdown of molecules and removing of acids and neutralise through which obtaining the various biproducts and finally we can obtain the biodiesel and it was utilised for various ratios and conducted each ratio experimented.
finally, due to experimental investigation rice bran biodiesel oil is utilised for domestic vehicles by small alteration in the engines.

Performance and evolution of grid connected to 5MW solar plant in Shivanasamudra.
The solar Photovoltaic 5 MW plant was installed in the Shivanasamudra by BHEL under Karnataka power corporation limited. The acquired land was 25 acres and investment is 75 crores.
Under the guidance of Dr. Nagana gowda, Director, National Training Center for Solar Technology. By using SCADA software collected each day data up to six months, and find out the performance of solar plant. The overall conclusion of plant is working satisfactorily and suggests some of the methods to improve the plant efficiency.
