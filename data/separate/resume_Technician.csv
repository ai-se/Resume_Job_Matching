Thanks,\nBill Kuhl\n3704 Mazewood Bill Lane Kuhl \xe2\x80\xa2 Fairfax, VA 22033\n571-***-**** \xe2\x80\xa2 adaji6@r.postjobfree.com\nSUMMARY\nI am a highly contributing employee who helps nourish a culture of teamwork and feedback among my peers.With over 18 years of experience working at Apple Inc., I have an intimate knowledge of Apple products and have integrated it with my passion for education. This has helped me greatly during my time as an IT Support Technician at Flint Hill School. I have a thirst for knowledge and learning about the latest tech which is the reason I still work for Apple part time. At Flint Hill I have many responsibilities ranging from troubleshooting software, repairing Macs, controlling content on the network through the web \xef\xac\x81lter, and managing devices using Jamf Pro\xe2\x80\x99s MDM solution. I am part of the team that manages and supports the One-to-One program for the Macs and iPads. Primarily, my time is spent planning for purchases, supervising device distribution, and facilitating the roll out of new technology through Apple DEP and Apple School Manager. Along with that, I help \xef\xac\x81nd solutions to problems and answers to questions pertaining to the program. I am currently testing, planning and \xef\xac\x81nalizing the roll out of our Two-to-One program for the middle school, where each student will have both an iPad and a MacBook Air to use for their studies. At Apple I help direct, lead, and grow a very technical group of Mac Geniuses. I have comprehensive experience with sales ranging from individual consumer to large companies with the business team. I also have expertise in inventory management, leadership, and continued motivation and training of my peers. Throughout my time at Apple I have played a key role in launching, promoting and supporting world- changing products and services. As one of the original Apple retail employees, I had the privilege of going through highly specialized training for interacting with customers and facilitated in creating a credo that ties the customer\xe2\x80\x99s needs as a \xef\xac\x81lter for everything we do. I personally collaborated with Steve Jobs on \xe2\x80\x98Project Nexus\xe2\x80\x99; the planning and launch of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s retail endeavor. As of today, Apple Retail is critical to their success and responsible for almost $100 billion dollars a year of net revenue; helping it become the world\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable company. The training and on boarding process I have experienced leads me to \xef\xac\x81rmly believe that when working with a customer, I\xe2\x80\x99m not just providing service- it\xe2\x80\x99s about giving each person an experience that will enrich their life. This has always proved bene\xef\xac\x81cial to me at creating rapport, establishing relationships and building trust with people of all ages.

Inc. in a desktop support role, both delivering a variety of technical, training and process solutions to all staff levels, working closely with C-Suite executives, Board members, business guests, service providers and employees. I was then promoted to the IT Systems Manager position in 2016 to take over key responsibilities for various projects and initiatives, including greater outsourcing of systems to the Cloud and minimizing costs and reducing reliance on internal staffing of the department. I wanted to devote my skills towards a greater, human-connected paradigm and mission, which lead my search into the not-for-profit space.\nMy roles at Atlantic required close coordination with our external IT consulting partners on projects and support, and I worked with the Director of Facilities extensively on many matters, including events AV setup and conference coordination, office supplies ordering, vendor service of copiers and printers, HVAC system troubleshooting, office lighting, ergonomics, phone system, guest access and electrical issues. I also advised and teamed up with the heads of multiple remote offices in furnishing supplies, building out and upgrading their office infrastructure with local providers. People-focused support is a cornerstone of my professional values, adding diligence and patience while giving them prompt and correct service. I provided responsive, creative and prioritized answers whenever available and became the main contact everyone looks to for advice, including non- technical. My strong relationships permeate at all levels through compassion, leadership, and resourcefulness. The hands-on problem-solving and analytical abilities I acquired over the years can be a strong contributor to the success of your organization. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this position, and my qualifications in greater detail with you. Thank you for your time and careful consideration.
