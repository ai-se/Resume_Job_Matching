ac5coq@r.postjobfree.com) while working at Microsoft: The student internship I tutored (was based on satisfying the professor’s criteria in conjunction with an FPGA project to satisfy a need for a Microsoft contractor and for that reason the internship that I managed was divided into two parts. The two parts were based on a succession of steps divided into an allotment of time progressions.

(1) The Professor’s (Mr. Friedrich) criteria were based on an advanced C Sharp (C#) class:
a. Created a data warehouse database structure that connects to the project for storing the information on the project and output being display.
b. Displayed quick sort, bubble sort, array sort, <T> List sort and explain the differences, including the advantages and disadvantages. Note that array sort is only based on reference.
c. Used functionality for stacks, heaps, lists and explain the differences.
d. Completed File System Operations (FSO) to write out in a text file and read back to the console.
e. Built interface signatures using inheritance, polymorphic behavior, abstract behavior concepts, including using delegates. To make it more interesting, we used a class library on instances to encrypt the data connections.

(2) The contracting company internship for this student that I managed was base on an FPGA project with a vast algorithm to show graphical output with parallel processing:
a. Designed and built a data warehouse with data mart structure that allows Artificial Intelligence (AI) near the processor with very fast precise speeds that have virtually no loads.
b. Showed various parts of the graphical data being streamed on each part of the algorithm and save the information directly to the data warehouse.
c. Use error control to display output errors and monitor variations of changes of the logic.
d. Graphed findings based on outputs, speed in nano-seconds with volumes (algorithmic millions of rows) of data through put for analyzing the results.

SUMMARY
I am a highly contributing employee who helps nourish a culture of teamwork and feedback among my peers.With over 18 years of experience working at Apple Inc., I have an intimate knowledge of Apple products and have integrated it with my passion for education. This has helped me greatly during my time as an IT Support Technician at Flint Hill School. I have a thirst for knowledge and learning about the latest tech which is the reason I still work for Apple part time. At Flint Hill I have many responsibilities ranging from troubleshooting software, repairing Macs, controlling content on the network through the web ﬁlter, and managing devices using Jamf Pro’s MDM solution. I am part of the team that manages and supports the One-to-One program for the Macs and iPads. Primarily, my time is spent planning for purchases, supervising device distribution, and facilitating the roll out of new technology through Apple DEP and Apple School Manager. Along with that, I help ﬁnd solutions to problems and answers to questions pertaining to the program. I am currently testing, planning and ﬁnalizing the roll out of our Two-to-One program for the middle school, where each student will have both an iPad and a MacBook Air to use for their studies. At Apple I help direct, lead, and grow a very technical group of Mac Geniuses. I have comprehensive experience with sales ranging from individual consumer to large companies with the business team. I also have expertise in inventory management, leadership, and continued motivation and training of my peers. Throughout my time at Apple I have played a key role in launching, promoting and supporting world- changing products and services. As one of the original Apple retail employees, I had the privilege of going through highly specialized training for interacting with customers and facilitated in creating a credo that ties the customer’s needs as a ﬁlter for everything we do. I personally collaborated with Steve Jobs on ‘Project Nexus’; the planning and launch of Apple’s retail endeavor. As of today, Apple Retail is critical to their success and responsible for almost $100 billion dollars a year of net revenue; helping it become the world’s most valuable company. The training and on boarding process I have experienced leads me to ﬁrmly believe that when working with a customer, I’m not just providing service- it’s about giving each person an experience that will enrich their life. This has always proved beneﬁcial to me at creating rapport, establishing relationships and building trust with people of all ages. EXPERIENCE

With 28 years of experience in performing rigging duties, and extensive knowledge of rigging equipment and their capacities, I am just the right candidate for the position of a Rigger/ Ropesman. I am confident that I can provide your organization with the expertise that it needs from a person in this position.

As noted on Resume, I am highly skilled in inspecting all applicable rigging, planning for lifts using the weight of the load, and able to estimate the lifting capacity of the equipment. Moreover, I possess advanced transportation knowledge with regards to moving equipment and materials from one point to another, able to attach load through slings, chains, cables, hooks, shackles and other interconnected tools.

I have the ability to work as part of a team but I am also self-motivated with the ability to perform my duties independently. I have lots of patience and I pay close attention to detail so I notice the small things that can make a big difference if not handled correctly.
I have excellent communication skills, problem- solving abilities, great eyesight and I am physically able to meet the requirements of this demanding job.

Dear Sir,
Your job posting for a Human Resources Manager caught my attention because my HR management experience has been matching with what you are looking for, so I am familiar with the challenges. In addition to leading the HR department, I am a strategic business partner in my current position and serve on the executive team.
My 22 years in HR as regional manager, have allowed me to grow and develop professionally and as a leader.
You are seeking an individual with a strong passion to innovate and drive for solutions. Since I started the HR department from scratch in my current organization and have led the adoption of all people processes, systems, policies, and procedures, I qualify. Personal accountability for results and my integrity are respected and unquestioned. I established a performance development and career planning process that utilizes both internal and external development opportunities for employees including mentoring, job-shadowing, team leadership, and classes.
I am most anxious to join an organization where HR is respected and where I can continue to provide input to the strategic business issues while implementing forward thinking HR and talent management strategies. Your advertised position appears to fit my experience, accomplishments, and education.
I am anxious to contribute to a new organization with the same energy, creativity, and commitment that I have brought to my past positions. Looking for a chance to interview with your team,
Regards,
Sincerely,
Bassam

Specialist IT for architecture / Infrastructure Servers and Network Worked with a global infrastructure and Architecture server’s specialist strategic team. The entire team was composed by around 40 people, but 10 from those, worked only on critical technical situations where the problem was affecting directly the company business itself. I was one of those 10. Responsible for Global COB.

All infrastructure (physical, security, and IT) has been relocated to new office looking to align beside Corp requirements; LP Brazil Integration Project: Already located in the new office integration project was ready to deploy. LP Brazil was sharing network and server infrastructure with a third company. This project was accomplished in 2 execution steps: 1st – administrative offices in Curitiba, and, 2nd factory plant in Ponta Grossa. LP Brazil with my lead was the first Louisiana Pacific Corporation to start to use thin clients in their offices, printing a new stage in entire company in how to work with virtualization processes.

This project would save for company more than USD1Million yearly. The initial investment would be of USD3Milion. Project was not concluded. Sykes Brazil Virtual Desktop Project:. The main Corp plan was sell to all sites locations this virtualized services. When I deeper analyzed the blue print global project, I realized that wouldn’t be a good solution for smaller sites. So, I projected another plan that was very welcome. My project was so new and innovating that locations as Asia Pacific and EMEA was very interested to build the same project model in their locations.
Sykes Brazil IT Team: IT area was working below standards in terms of quality and productivity. I was suggested to fire all area and hire a brand new team. I would never do that.

October 3rd, 2019
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am submitting for your consideration, my interest in the opportunity to join the Open Space Institute as its IT/Facilities Coordinator.
I joined The Atlantic Philanthropies in 2007 as an IT Support Lead, after spending 5 years at Yahoo! Inc. in a desktop support role, both delivering a variety of technical, training and process solutions to all staff levels, working closely with C-Suite executives, Board members, business guests, service providers and employees. I was then promoted to the IT Systems Manager position in 2016 to take over key responsibilities for various projects and initiatives, including greater outsourcing of systems to the Cloud and minimizing costs and reducing reliance on internal staffing of the department. I wanted to devote my skills towards a greater, human-connected paradigm and mission, which lead my search into the not-for-profit space.
My roles at Atlantic required close coordination with our external IT consulting partners on projects and support, and I worked with the Director of Facilities extensively on many matters, including events AV setup and conference coordination, office supplies ordering, vendor service of copiers and printers, HVAC system troubleshooting, office lighting, ergonomics, phone system, guest access and electrical issues. I also advised and teamed up with the heads of multiple remote offices in furnishing supplies, building out and upgrading their office infrastructure with local providers. People-focused support is a cornerstone of my professional values, adding diligence and patience while giving them prompt and correct service. I provided responsive, creative and prioritized answers whenever available and became the main contact everyone looks to for advice, including non- technical. My strong relationships permeate at all levels through compassion, leadership, and resourcefulness. The hands-on problem-solving and analytical abilities I acquired over the years can be a strong contributor to the success of your organization. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this position, and my qualifications in greater detail with you. Thank you for your time and careful consideration. Sincerely,
Steven Chang
