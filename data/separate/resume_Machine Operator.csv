To whom it may concern;
I am currently the Maintenance Manager for an automotive supplier. My duties also include doing all the PLC programming (all Allen Bradley RsLogix 500 and 5000), HMI programming (Allen Bradley), and Fanuc robot programming/troubleshooting as well as electrical upgrades/installation and troubleshooting.
During my career I have implemented ideas to improve machine uptime and scheduled downtime with the management group to do pm’s and repairs to reduce overtime as well as have worked with vendors to reduce cost. I have made items common between all our machines to reduce the amount of inventory needed in our crib therefore reducing out overhead costs.
I have traveled to some of other facilities to assist them with issues that they have been having using some of our improvements and lessons learned.
Have worked hand in hand with MIOSHA on our lockout tagout procedure and among other safety improvements in our plant. We have gone from having numerous findings to them wanting to issue us an award for our safety.
I have been in charge of numerous equipment and line installs. I take pride in the fact that we can do most in house without hiring outside contractors. From the machine setup to the utilities installation to the work flow and tuning in parts for cmm layout.
I got my start in this industry about 30 years ago. I started out as a machinist and moved to programming CNC mills and lathes. I then moved on to machine tool building and electrical work. I am strongly motivated and am hungry to learn new things.

Thank you for your time

Re: Motel Manager

Dear Sir or Madam:

I am writing in response to your advertisement for a Motel Manager. I have over 18 years experience as Hotel General Manager. I believe I possess the necessary skills and experience you are seeking and would make a valuable addition to your company.

I have lots of experience with hiring, training, scheduling and supervising staff. I was always the person in charge of monitoring and ordering supplies in my previous Hotel position. I would always be on the lookout for ways to save money without compromising quality. I also have basic knowledge of repairs and maintenance and of alarm and fire systems. I have done all aspects of payroll and bookkeeping. I am familiar with front desk computer systems.

I believe myself and the staff could achieve and maintain a high standard of cleanliness, consistency and customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is of the highest priority in order to maintain and increase a base of repeat customers. Regular inspections are a must to maintain consistent cleanliness and quality standards both inside and outside the building.

If there is accommodation available I would like to live on site. Having management on site 24 hours has many advantages. I would be there to deal with emergencies and any other serious issues that may arise.

My wife has a background in cleaning and would be an asset in ensuring the room cleaning would be done to a high standard.

I am seeking long term employment.
I look forward to discussing the position with you.

Sincerely
Michael Brise

SELECTED ACHIEVEMENTS

Westinghouse Electric

STP Standard Functional Design Handbook - Compiled a reference book with a chapter dedicated to each of the identified tasks in the Functional Design process for the South Texas Project (STP). Each chapter contained instructions for the engineer to follow in order to successfully complete the task for their assigned system. When all of the tasks in the handbook were complete then the Functional Design should be complete and ready for lead review before moving on to software testing.

Toshiba Turbine Control Datalink Interface - Developed the first test procedure for Toshiba Turbine Control Datalink Interface. Worked on test floor in pre-FAT testing to debug the procedure and then remained through customer witness test.

Turbine Control Datalink Interface Timing Test - Developed the first procedure for Toshiba Turbine Control Datalink Interface Timing Test. This involved high speed video recording to capture when buttons were pressed and indicators would change state by examining the video time stamp. Worked on test floor in pre-FAT testing to debug the procedure and then remained through customer witness test.

Rockwell Automation

Spooler - Developed a wire spooler that used a hydraulic cylinder to position the spool and had a linear pot for position feedback. The system worked well for copper wire, which had a square cross section. Aluminum wire, however, with a thin and wide rectangular cross section, would overlap adjacent wraps which is unacceptable for proper spooling. After much investigation, I found the linear pot, which had an accuracy spec of 0.1%, deviated by as much as +/- 0.125 inches. I added a correction function in software to compensate for the feedback deviation and achieved optimum performance with both copper and aluminum wire.

Open RNV - Developed customer base to justify and sustain new regional facility in Charlotte.

Sustain RNV - Worked as member of matrix management team for corporate High Score Champion awards in 2004 and 2006. Consistently had the highest margins of all drive centers and in the top three for net profit. RNV had a record year in 2006 where we profited $2,000,000 with only 10 employees.

Plotter - Implemented procedure to plot panel layout drawings at full scale to be used as drilling templates. This reduced labor 4 hours per panel for an average savings of $1,600 per month.

IP - Received Chairman’s Outstanding Teamwork award for my role in the International Paper Disaster Recovery Team in 2000.

Jagenberg Sheeter - Developed the control system for a Jagenberg Sheeter that utilized air motors for a dual turret unwind. This system successfully achieved “splice-on-the-fly” with the air motor bringing the new roll up to speed for the splice cycle.

SanforTrol - Developed a closed loop control system to regulate shrinkage in a textile machine. This was the very first system of its type and gave the OEM a substantial market advantage. (This system is proprietary to Morrison Textiles.)

Auto Grind - Automated the procedure to grind and resurface the rubber conveyor belt used to propel the material in the SanforTrol machine. (This system is proprietary to Morrison Textiles.)

Ball Warper - Developed a new Ball Warper machine which utilized a servo and linear actuator for the traverse. This is the only machine with this revolutionary concept, and gives the OEM a substantial market advantage. (This system is proprietary to Morrison Textiles.)

The rate of exchange used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date and may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. Mastercard®. All Mastercard purchases and cash advances will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. Currently, the rate of exchange used is either a government-mandated rate or a wholesale rate determined by Mastercard International for the processing cycle in which the transaction is processed. This rate of exchange may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. American Express®. All American Express purchases and cash advances will be billed to you in U.S. dollars. Purchases and cash advances in a foreign currency will be converted to U.S. dollars. The rate of exchange used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by American Express. 8. Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) and Interest Charges. a. APRs. Your account is assigned APRs for purchases, balance transfers, convenience checks, and cash advances. These APRs are used to calculate your interest charges. See the Credit Card Pricing Terms for the APRs that apply to your account transactions.
b. Variable APR. Unless noted otherwise, your APR will vary based on the U.S. Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal. This means your APR will increase if the U.S. Prime Rate increases and decrease if the U.S. Prime Rate decreases. An increase or decrease in the APR will increase or decrease the total amount of interest you pay. Therefore, the amount of your minimum payment applied to interest will increase or decrease. Your APR for purchases, balance transfers, and convenience checks, if you request them, is your “Standard APR.” Your Standard APR is adjusted monthly on the first business day of the month; it is determined by adding a Margin to the U.S. Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the first day of the previous month. The Margin is a percentage amount that we determine based on an evaluation of your credit history. Your Margin for your Standard APR may be found in the Variable Rate Information paragraph under the Credit Card Pricing Terms table. Your cash advance APR is 2.00% higher than your Standard APR, not to exceed the maximum permitted by law. For example: If the U.S. Prime Rate is 4.00% and your Margin is 9.00%, then your variable APR for purchases, balance transfers, and convenience checks will be 13.00% APR (4.00% U.S. Prime Rate + 9.00% Margin = 13.00% APR). Your APR for cash advances will be 15.00% APR (4.00% U.S. Prime Rate + 9.00% Margin + 2.00% cash advance added rate = 15.00% APR). c. Promotional APRs. If your account is eligible for one or more introductory promotional APRs, the Credit Card Pricing Terms sets forth the APR amount, its duration, and the corresponding Standard APR and cash advance APR applicable to your account at the time it is opened. If a promotional rate is offered after your account is opened, the terms applicable to that promotional APR will be provided at that time. After the promotional APR expires, the remaining balance incurred under the promotion will be subject to your Standard APR or cash advance APR, as applicable. d. Penalty APR. If you do not make your minimum payment by the due date and your account is over 60 days past due or you make a payment that is returned and causes your account to be over 60 days past due, your account will be subject to the Penalty APR. The Penalty APR will be applied to any and all transactions and outstanding balances on your account, including those with Promotional APRs. The Penalty APR will be effective at least 45 days after your account becomes subject to it. e. How We Calculate Your Interest Charges. To calculate your interest charges, Navy Federal uses your periodic rate, which is determined by dividing your APR by 12. Navy Federal then calculates monthly interest charges on your account by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of your account, including current transactions. To calculate the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases and cash advances, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid interest charges. The resulting total is the daily balance. We then add together all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This amount is your average daily balance. 9. Lost or Stolen Cards, Account Numbers, or Checks. Liability for Unauthorized Use. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card account, you should write to us or call us immediately at the address or telephone number included in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement. You may also contact us on the web at navyfederal.org. You will not be responsible for charges made to your account that are found by us to be unauthorized.
10. Consumer Reporting Agencies. Navy Federal may report information about your credit card account to consumer reporting agencies. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. Information may be reported in your name and your Authorized Users’ names, if any. We may also access your consumer credit report for any permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including periodic reviews of your creditworthiness, collections, and future credit line increases or decreases, and to display your credit score within your online banking and mobile access. 11. Default. We may close your account or require immediate repayment of your total account balance, to the extent allowed by law, if any of the default events occur:
• You violate any terms of this Agreement;
• You do not pay the amount due as listed on your monthly statement;
• You have a returned payment that causes your account to be delinquent;
• You default under another account agreement you have with us;
• You file bankruptcy, or some other insolvency proceeding is filed by or against you;
• You are declared incompetent, mentally incapacitated, or in the event of your death;
• We determine that there has been a substantial adverse impact on your ability to repay the balance on this account;
• We determine that you have engaged in suspicious, fraudulent, illegal, dishonest, or deceptive activities with respect to any of your Navy Federal accounts; or
• If the amount of deposited funds held as security on your share secured card (if you have one) is insufficient. If we require immediate repayment of your total account balance, we may also declare due and payable all costs relating to the collection of your account, including, but not limited to, unassessed interest charges, court costs, expenses, and attorney fees.
Navy Federal may obtain any information it deems necessary to cure or collect the default amount, including your current contact information, as permitted by law. Contact to your employer will be limited to obtaining current contact information.
You may have a Penalty APR applied to your account under certain circumstances. Refer to the Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) and Interest Charges section of this Agreement for more information. 12. Closing or Suspending Your Account. We may, without notice or demand, close your account or suspend your account by denying use of the credit line. You may close your account with us at any time. To do so, call or write to us using the contact information in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement. You may close your account without being charged any fees up until the time you use the account or make a payment on the account after receiving a billing statement. If we close or suspend your account, or if you close your account, you must pay us all amounts you owe on the account, even if they post to your account after it is closed or suspended. We may cancel your current card and issue you a substitute card at any time. Every card issued by Navy Federal is the property of Navy Federal.
13. How We May Contact You. You expressly agree that to service your account or to collect any amounts you may owe us, we or authorized parties may call you and send text messages to you. We may use prerecorded/ artificial voice messages or an automatic dialing device to contact you at any telephone number associated with your account, including mobile telephone numbers, which could result in charges to you. You also expressly consent that we may send email messages regarding your account to your email address. In addition, we may send you communications related to your account through the U.S. mail or other mail service. You agree to notify us promptly of any changes to your contact information, including your name, mailing address, telephone number(s), and email address(es). 14. Use of Card for Illegal or Risky Transactions. It is your responsibility to comply with all laws when using your Navy Federal Credit Card. You agree to hold us harmless for any damages or other liability arising from a transaction initiated by you or your Authorized User, if any, for the purpose of conducting an illegal activity. We reserve the right to decline authorization of transactions for activities we believe may violate law or pose significant risk to us or our members.
15. Your Billing Rights: Keep This Document for Future Use. This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at the address provided in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement or at navyfederal.org. In your letter, give us the following information:
• Account information: Your name and account number.
• Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
• Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
• within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
• at least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.
© 2019 Navy Federal NFCU 573CC (7-19) page 3 of 3
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing or electronically. You may call us, but if you do, we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1) Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.
2) Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
• We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that account.
• The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.
• While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
• We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
• If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
• If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us telling us that you still refuse to pay within one complete billing cycle. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true: 1) The purchase must have been made in your home state within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2) You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3) You must not have yet fully paid for the purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at the address provided in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement or at navyfederal.org. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.
16. Notice Concerning Use of an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM). Be alert. Do not use the ATM if the lights are not in operation or you see suspicious activity. Take someone with you if you must make a transaction at night. If you sense someone attempting to view your transaction, cancel the transaction and leave. Remember to take your card, cash, and receipt and put them away. Count your money only when you are safely away from the ATM area. Immediately report all crimes to the operator of the ATM and to local law enforcement officials. 17. Fees. The following fee information is in addition to the fee information found in the Credit Card Pricing Terms. a. Annual Fees. If you have been issued a Visa Signature Flagship Rewards Card, you will be billed the annual membership fee. This charge will appear on your first statement, and annually thereafter. Only one fee will be charged to your account regardless of the number of cards issued on the account. If you do not want to pay the annual fee, you may request that your account be closed any time prior to the last day of the anniversary month when the account was opened. Upon closing your account, your annual fee for the period will be credited back to your account and reflected on your next statement. To make this request, you may contact us at the phone numbers, website, or address provided in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement. b. Late Payment Fee. You will be required to pay a late payment fee of up to $20.00 if you do not pay at least the minimum payment by the payment due date on your statement. Navy Federal may also assess the late payment fee every month thereafter that you are past due. c. How Fees Are Categorized. Fees are categorized as purchases on your periodic statement and are included in your purchases balance. Fees are not eligible for promotional rates unless otherwise stated in your promotional offer. 18. Authorized Users.
Adding an Authorized User. You or a joint owner may request to add Authorized Users to your account, subject to a maximum number set by Navy Federal. You may make the request by phone, in writing, or at navyfederal.org using the information provided in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement. You are responsible for obtaining permission from each Authorized User before naming him or her as an Authorized User on your account. We will need the following information for each requested Authorized User:
• Full name as it should appear on the card
• Date of birth
• Social Security Number
• Address
• Telephone Number
• Access Number if a Navy Federal Member
You are responsible for:
• any transaction made by an Authorized User on your account.
• any transaction made by an Authorized User before they were removed from your account, even if the transaction posts after the date of the removal request.
• any transactions made by others if an Authorized User allows them to use your account.
• fees and charges resulting from any transaction made by an Authorized User or others, if an Authorized User allows them to use your account.
Spend Limits. You have the ability to limit the amount of your credit line an Authorized User can access by adjusting their Spend Limit. To adjust your Authorized User’s Spend Limit, contact us by telephone or access the Manage Card Holder's Limits feature through our online banking service. Authorized Users can:
• make transactions, including purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances on your account;
• report their own card lost or stolen;
• initiate billing disputes;
• make payments;
• obtain certain account information such as transaction history;
• request they be removed from the account as an Authorized User;
• change the billing address for your account; and
• request a credit balance refund.
Navy Federal may, from time to time and without notice, modify what Authorized Users can do. 19. Amendment to This Agreement and Changes to Benefits. a. Amendments. Navy Federal may amend and change this Agreement, including rates, by providing an advance written notice of the changes to you when required by law. However, we may reduce charges, fees, and rates without sending you an advance notice.
b. Changing Benefits. Credit card benefits offered as part of your credit card account–such as rewards, services, and other features–may be modified or discontinued at any time for any reason. Separate terms and conditions apply to these and other benefits associated with your credit card account. 20. Military Lending Act Protections. Under the Military Lending Act, the following statement applies to covered borrowers (Active Duty servicemembers and their dependents) with accounts established on or after October 3, 2017:
Federal law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the cost of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual percentage rate of 36 percent. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: The costs associated with credit insurance premiums; fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction; any application fee

CARPENTER/INSTALLATION SPECIALIST,
A & D RENOVATIONS (2017-2018)
LOVELACE SERVICE CO. (2009-2012)
My Daily tasks for each of these company’s was to remodel, construct, install or repair any and all household products including appliances, wood work, flooring, roofing, drywall work, painting, and much more. The objective of each job through my eyes was to walk into a project seeing the worst of a situation and constructing/remodeling/repairing the problem to the point where not only the customer was satisfied, but I would need a sense of satisfaction for myself in order for a job to be properly completed and professionally done. MARCH 2016 – JULY 2017
OPERATOR (MACHINE OPERATOR & FORKLIFT OPERATOR),
HOOVER TREATED WOOD PRODUCTS INC.
This company was highly particular on production. My duties as a machine (Stacker) operator were to mechanically stack plywood/lumber to be treated, stocked and/or shipped. Layer count was the primary focus which is how many layers of wood the operator and his crew can stack and prepare for treatment/shipment during each shift. If the production rate wasn’t up to standards, the office would usually make a change in operators because of the importance of production at Hoover. I also spent time as a forklift operator at this same Plant. The duties of a driver consist of, but aren’t limited to, loading/unloading the stacker machines with whatever product they are running that day, stocking the yard with wood that has been stacked for treatment, loading/unloading the kilns in order to dry the wood and prepare it for shipment. LOADER, DELIVERY DRIVER, CUSTOMER SERVICE REP., CASHIER, INVENTORY SPECIALIST, FORKLIFT DRIVER
ALTHEIMER LUMBER COMPANY (2001-2006)
My Grandfather owned and operated this company for forty plus years. I started working for him in Jr high school and learned various tricks of the trade. This is where I learned to provide 2
customer service, I became familiar with lumber and plywood, as well as hardware, household appliances, paint and the many other items that my grandfather’s company had to offer. I first learned how to operate a forklift which mainly consisted of loading/unloading flatbed trucks for shipping/receiving. I was basically taught how the lumber business works as it pertains to the products, but more importantly how it pertains to the customer. I have been involved in construction for many years due to the fact of my grandfather being a contractor and having a lumber company, having two uncles with construction businesses, and working with various individuals that were friends and colleagues of my family. They all specialized in construction and remodeling and I have learned quite a bit over the years and just wanted to express that in this description.
