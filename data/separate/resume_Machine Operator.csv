Each chapter contained instructions for the engineer to follow in order to successfully complete the task for their assigned system. When all of the tasks in the handbook were complete then the Functional Design should be complete and ready for lead review before moving on to software testing.\n\nToshiba Turbine Control Datalink Interface - Developed the first test procedure for Toshiba Turbine Control Datalink Interface.

This involved high speed video recording to capture when buttons were pressed and indicators would change state by examining the video time stamp. Worked on test floor in pre-FAT testing to debug the procedure and then remained through customer witness test.\n\nRockwell Automation\n\nSpooler - Developed a wire spooler that used a hydraulic cylinder to position the spool and had a linear pot for position feedback. The system worked well for copper wire, which had a square cross section. Aluminum wire, however, with a thin and wide rectangular cross section, would overlap adjacent wraps which is unacceptable for proper spooling. After much investigation, I found the linear pot, which had an accuracy spec of 0.1%, deviated by as much as +/- 0.125 inches. I added a correction function in software to compensate for the feedback deviation and achieved optimum performance with both copper and aluminum wire.\n\nOpen RNV - Developed customer base to justify and sustain new regional facility in Charlotte.\n\nSustain RNV - Worked as member of matrix management team for corporate High Score Champion awards in 2004 and 2006. Consistently had the highest margins of all drive centers and in the top three for net profit. RNV had a record year in 2006 where we profited $2,000,000 with only 10 employees.\n\nPlotter - Implemented procedure to plot panel layout drawings at full scale to be used as drilling templates. This reduced labor 4 hours per panel for an average savings of $1,600 per month.\n\nIP - Received Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s Outstanding Teamwork award for my role in the International Paper Disaster Recovery Team in 2000.\n\nJagenberg Sheeter - Developed the control system for a Jagenberg Sheeter that utilized air motors for a dual turret unwind. This system successfully achieved \xe2\x80\x9csplice-on-the-fly\xe2\x80\x9d with the air motor bringing the new roll up to speed for the splice cycle.\n\nSanforTrol - Developed a closed loop control system to regulate shrinkage in a textile machine. This was the very first system of its type and gave the OEM a substantial market advantage. (This system is proprietary to Morrison Textiles.)\n\nAuto Grind - Automated the procedure to grind and resurface the rubber conveyor belt used to propel the material in the SanforTrol machine. (This system is proprietary to Morrison Textiles.)\n\nBall Warper - Developed a new Ball Warper machine which utilized a servo and linear actuator for the traverse. This is the only machine with this revolutionary concept, and gives the OEM a substantial market advantage.

This means your APR will increase if the U.S. Prime Rate increases and decrease if the U.S. Prime Rate decreases. An increase or decrease in the APR will increase or decrease the total amount of interest you pay. Therefore, the amount of your minimum payment applied to interest will increase or decrease. Your APR for purchases, balance transfers, and convenience checks, if you request them, is your \xe2\x80\x9cStandard APR.\xe2\x80\x9d Your Standard APR is adjusted monthly on the first business day of the month; it is determined by adding a Margin to the U.S. Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the first day of the previous month. The Margin is a percentage amount that we determine based on an evaluation of your credit history. Your Margin for your Standard APR may be found in the Variable Rate Information paragraph under the Credit Card Pricing Terms table. Your cash advance APR is 2.00% higher than your Standard APR, not to exceed the maximum permitted by law. For example: If the U.S. Prime Rate is 4.00% and your Margin is 9.00%, then your variable APR for purchases, balance transfers, and convenience checks will be 13.00% APR (4.00% U.S. Prime Rate + 9.00% Margin = 13.00% APR). Your APR for cash advances will be 15.00% APR (4.00% U.S. Prime Rate + 9.00% Margin + 2.00% cash advance added rate = 15.00% APR). c. Promotional APRs. If your account is eligible for one or more introductory promotional APRs, the Credit Card Pricing Terms sets forth the APR amount, its duration, and the corresponding Standard APR and cash advance APR applicable to your account at the time it is opened. If a promotional rate is offered after your account is opened, the terms applicable to that promotional APR will be provided at that time. After the promotional APR expires, the remaining balance incurred under the promotion will be subject to your Standard APR or cash advance APR, as applicable. d. Penalty APR. If you do not make your minimum payment by the due date and your account is over 60 days past due or you make a payment that is returned and causes your account to be over 60 days past due, your account will be subject to the Penalty APR. The Penalty APR will be applied to any and all transactions and outstanding balances on your account, including those with Promotional APRs. The Penalty APR will be effective at least 45 days after your account becomes subject to it. e. How We Calculate Your Interest Charges. To calculate your interest charges, Navy Federal uses your periodic rate, which is determined by dividing your APR by 12. Navy Federal then calculates monthly interest charges on your account by applying the periodic rate to the average daily balance of your account, including current transactions. To calculate the average daily balance, we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases and cash advances, and subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid interest charges. The resulting total is the daily balance. We then add together all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This amount is your average daily balance. 9. Lost or Stolen Cards, Account Numbers, or Checks. Liability for Unauthorized Use. If you notice the loss or theft of your credit card or possible unauthorized use of your card account, you should write to us or call us immediately at the address or telephone number included in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement. You may also contact us on the web at navyfederal.org. You will not be responsible for charges made to your account that are found by us to be unauthorized.\n10. Consumer Reporting Agencies. Navy Federal may report information about your credit card account to consumer reporting agencies. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. Information may be reported in your name and your Authorized Users\xe2\x80\x99 names, if any. We may also access your consumer credit report for any permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including periodic reviews of your creditworthiness, collections, and future credit line increases or decreases, and to display your credit score within your online banking and mobile access. 11. Default. We may close your account or require immediate repayment of your total account balance, to the extent allowed by law, if any of the default events occur:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You violate any terms of this Agreement;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You do not pay the amount due as listed on your monthly statement;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You have a returned payment that causes your account to be delinquent;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You default under another account agreement you have with us;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You file bankruptcy, or some other insolvency proceeding is filed by or against you;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 You are declared incompetent, mentally incapacitated, or in the event of your death;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We determine that there has been a substantial adverse impact on your ability to repay the balance on this account;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We determine that you have engaged in suspicious, fraudulent, illegal, dishonest, or deceptive activities with respect to any of your Navy Federal accounts; or\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If the amount of deposited funds held as security on your share secured card (if you have one) is insufficient. If we require immediate repayment of your total account balance, we may also declare due and payable all costs relating to the collection of your account, including, but not limited to, unassessed interest charges, court costs, expenses, and attorney fees.\nNavy Federal may obtain any information it deems necessary to cure or collect the default amount, including your current contact information, as permitted by law. Contact to your employer will be limited to obtaining current contact information.\nYou may have a Penalty APR applied to your account under certain circumstances. Refer to the Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) and Interest Charges section of this Agreement for more information. 12. Closing or Suspending Your Account. We may, without notice or demand, close your account or suspend your account by denying use of the credit line. You may close your account with us at any time. To do so, call or write to us using the contact information in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement. You may close your account without being charged any fees up until the time you use the account or make a payment on the account after receiving a billing statement. If we close or suspend your account, or if you close your account, you must pay us all amounts you owe on the account, even if they post to your account after it is closed or suspended. We may cancel your current card and issue you a substitute card at any time. Every card issued by Navy Federal is the property of Navy Federal.\n13. How We May Contact You. You expressly agree that to service your account or to collect any amounts you may owe us, we or authorized parties may call you and send text messages to you. We may use prerecorded/ artificial voice messages or an automatic dialing device to contact you at any telephone number associated with your account, including mobile telephone numbers, which could result in charges to you. You also expressly consent that we may send email messages regarding your account to your email address. In addition, we may send you communications related to your account through the U.S. mail or other mail service. You agree to notify us promptly of any changes to your contact information, including your name, mailing address, telephone number(s), and email address(es). 14. Use of Card for Illegal or Risky Transactions. It is your responsibility to comply with all laws when using your Navy Federal Credit Card. You agree to hold us harmless for any damages or other liability arising from a transaction initiated by you or your Authorized User, if any, for the purpose of conducting an illegal activity. We reserve the right to decline authorization of transactions for activities we believe may violate law or pose significant risk to us or our members.\n15. Your Billing Rights: Keep This Document for Future Use. This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act. What To Do If You Find A Mistake On Your Statement If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at the address provided in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement or at navyfederal.org. In your letter, give us the following information:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Account information: Your name and account number.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.\nYou must contact us:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 at least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.\n\xc2\xa9 2019 Navy Federal NFCU 573CC (7-19) page 3 of 3\nYou must notify us of any potential errors in writing or electronically. You may call us, but if you do, we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question. What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things: 1) Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.\n2) Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that account.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit. After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us telling us that you still refuse to pay within one complete billing cycle. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.\nYour Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.\nTo use this right, all of the following must be true: 1) The purchase must have been made in your home state within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.) 2) You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify. 3) You must not have yet fully paid for the purchase. If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing or electronically at the address provided in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement or at navyfederal.org. While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.\n16. Notice Concerning Use of an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM). Be alert. Do not use the ATM if the lights are not in operation or you see suspicious activity. Take someone with you if you must make a transaction at night. If you sense someone attempting to view your transaction, cancel the transaction and leave. Remember to take your card, cash, and receipt and put them away. Count your money only when you are safely away from the ATM area. Immediately report all crimes to the operator of the ATM and to local law enforcement officials. 17. Fees. The following fee information is in addition to the fee information found in the Credit Card Pricing Terms. a. Annual Fees. If you have been issued a Visa Signature Flagship Rewards Card, you will be billed the annual membership fee. This charge will appear on your first statement, and annually thereafter. Only one fee will be charged to your account regardless of the number of cards issued on the account. If you do not want to pay the annual fee, you may request that your account be closed any time prior to the last day of the anniversary month when the account was opened. Upon closing your account, your annual fee for the period will be credited back to your account and reflected on your next statement. To make this request, you may contact us at the phone numbers, website, or address provided in the Contacting Us section of this Agreement. b. Late Payment Fee. You will be required to pay a late payment fee of up to $20.00 if you do not pay at least the minimum payment by the payment due date on your statement.

EUSEPPI\n**** * **** ******, ***.*** Pine Bluff, AR 71603 \xc2\xb7 870-***-****\nac9xmf@r.postjobfree.com\nI believe my work ethic alongside my various experience in many fields and my dedication to any job makes me a potentially valuable asset to any company. I have over twenty years of experience with gaming technology and My primary focus is to prove that I am a genuinely hard working American citizen that will be beneficial to any company that may employ me. If given this chance, I would love to build a career with your company and become an important employee with great responsibility. EXPERIENCE\nCARPENTER/INSTALLATION SPECIALIST,\nA & D RENOVATIONS (2017-2018)\nLOVELACE SERVICE CO. (2009-2012)\nMy Daily tasks for each of these company\xe2\x80\x99s was to remodel, construct, install or repair any and all household products including appliances, wood work, flooring, roofing, drywall work, painting, and much more. The objective of each job through my eyes was to walk into a project seeing the worst of a situation and constructing/remodeling/repairing the problem to the point where not only the customer was satisfied, but I would need a sense of satisfaction for myself in order for a job to be properly completed and professionally done. MARCH 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 JULY 2017\nOPERATOR (MACHINE OPERATOR & FORKLIFT OPERATOR),\nHOOVER TREATED WOOD PRODUCTS INC.\nThis company was highly particular on production. My duties as a machine (Stacker) operator were to mechanically stack plywood/lumber to be treated, stocked and/or shipped. Layer count was the primary focus which is how many layers of wood the operator and his crew can stack and prepare for treatment/shipment during each shift. If the production rate wasn\xe2\x80\x99t up to standards, the office would usually make a change in operators because of the importance of production at Hoover. I also spent time as a forklift operator at this same Plant. The duties of a driver consist of, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t limited to, loading/unloading the stacker machines with whatever product they are running that day, stocking the yard with wood that has been stacked for treatment, loading/unloading the kilns in order to dry the wood and prepare it for shipment. LOADER, DELIVERY DRIVER, CUSTOMER SERVICE REP., CASHIER, INVENTORY SPECIALIST, FORKLIFT DRIVER\nALTHEIMER LUMBER COMPANY (2001-2006)\nMy Grandfather owned and operated this company for forty plus years. I started working for him in Jr high school and learned various tricks of the trade. This is where I learned to provide 2\ncustomer service, I became familiar with lumber and plywood, as well as hardware, household appliances, paint and the many other items that my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s company had to offer. I first learned how to operate a forklift which mainly consisted of loading/unloading flatbed trucks for shipping/receiving. I was basically taught how the lumber business works as it pertains to the products, but more importantly how it pertains to the customer. I have been involved in construction for many years due to the fact of my grandfather being a contractor and having a lumber company, having two uncles with construction businesses, and working with various individuals that were friends and colleagues of my family. They all specialized in construction and remodeling and I have learned quite a bit over the years and just wanted to express that in this description.\nEDUCATION\nMONTH YEAR\nASSOCIATE OF ARTS DEGREE, SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS COLLEGE MONTH YEAR\nBACHELORS OF SCIENCE-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT,PSYCHOLOGY (PENDING DEGREE; 2 MORE SEMESTERS UNTIL DEGREE IS ACHIEVED) UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS AT MONTICELLO\nSKILLS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tech Savvy- Very good with computers and\nvarious technological devices\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Advanced Placement in Mathematics\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Educated in business and psychology\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hard working and dependable\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Always looking to better myself and any\ncompany I am employed by.\nACTIVITIES\nAs mentioned in my skills, I am not only good with mathematics but have a desire to work with numbers if at all possible. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost a hobby of mine to be able to problem solve or come up with a solution when pertaining to numbers. I am very good people, therefore customer relations are no issue at all. I am a part time music producer which would explain my familiarity with technology and my ability to perform tasks with most technological devices on the market today. I have experience in many areas and I know I am a genuinely good worker which makes me valuable to any company. I have always been told that my intelligence far exceeds my peers and family members, not mentioning that in a boastful way, just mentioning that I have the capacity to do any job that is given to me, no matter how much time it takes, or how impossible it may seem. I am very good with problem solving and would very much appreciate a chance to start a career with your corporation.
