Senior Software Engineer

Duration:6 month

Cleveland-OH

Skype

Senior software engineer,
and ideally, this would be someone who can work in both the
mobile and web space.

The role initially will be mobile (which is the focus of the
job description), but will eventually move into a full stack
position which will require working in Go! and Ruby on Rails.

Required Experience:

At a minimum you must have at least 5 years of software engineer
experience. By that we don t mean 5 years of fiddling around as a
hobby. We mean daily experience designing and implementing code.

Having a college degree is important but if you don t have one
then be able to explain why not, we are an understanding group.

Solid OOD skills. Your experience needs to show you have the
ability to design and implement extensible and reusable software.

Experience with Objective-C. This means that you have written one
or more apps using it and that it s taken you at least a year to
write the app (or apps). If that is true then you better know how to
upload the app to Test Flight and understand the nuances or
certificates and provisioning.

Knowledge of what a Cocoa Pod is and how to create and use one.

Knowledge of MVC design pattern and other patterns (e.g., Singleton).

Experience with Xaramin. We know Xaramin hasn t been out for
decades but we require experience with it, including how to upload
an app to the App Store and the Google Play store using it.

Self-driven and focused. You must have the ability to work
remotely without your boss sitting next to you reminding you to turn
the TV off and to stop surfing the web.

Problem solver. Not afraid to solve complex problems and defend
your position. In other words, you have to be technical and be able
to determine which solution is the better solution.

Ability to write documentation. You ll need to understand grammar
and how to construct your thoughts into words that others can understand.

Have a tough skin. Others will review your design and work so
don t pout when they comment on it. Take comments in stride and
learn from them or teach others that their comment was incorrect.

Experience with Git. If you don t know what Git is then take a few
days or a week and get experience.

Experience with macOS and iOS. If you don t have this then you may
not want to apply because we use Apple computers (for better or
worse) as our development machines.

Experience seeing risks in a schedule and knowing when to speak up.

Experience meeting deadlines and not being afraid to but in extra
time during high pressure parts of the project. We understand that
there is more to life than work but we also have to create products
to stay in business which means we have schedules and deadlines. If
you are afraid to push hard during crunch time then this may not be
the place for you.

Preferred Experience:

Experience with encryption on iOS and Android.

Experience with human factors and good UI practices.

Experience with designing and implementing custom UI controls on
iOS and Android.

Experience with data validation and why it is a necessary in any
design, not just good designs.

Experience with client/server design and implementation.

Employment & Personal Projects

Oct 17 – Aug 19
Beijer Electronics (Malmö, Sweden) – Software Development Engineer

At Beijer, our team had 2 core responsibilities as we developed our IioT platform: 1) Our dashboard product - a customizable web app for visualizing data transmitted though Azure from IoT devices on factory floors in remote locations. 2) The services, APIs and infrastructure to handle data transmission to/from Azure, licensing and user/device/data management.

Tech Stack: .Net Core, EmberJs, Qunit, SASS, xUnit, NSubstitute, TeamCity, Azure Functions, Azure IoT Hub

Specific Achievements:
• Built microservices which allowed us to create and enforce licensing, and accept or reject telemetry data from factory devices based on the validity of a device’s license.
• Developed a real-time, animated chart, which displayed live values for multiple data points received from Azure through a WebSocket connection. Featured smooth scrolling as the user-specified time interval elapsed.
Was our most popular data-display graphic on the dashboard product during beta-testing, based on customer feedback.
• Helped increase code coverage of the entire JavaScript code base from 40 to 70% during Summer 2018.
• Collaborated with another teammate to create the Azure function apps to handle the processing of incoming telemetry data from IoT devices so that it could be stored in Azure Blob Storage, ready for later use whenever a dashboard project was loaded and subsequently requested the latest telemetry, or a historical record of past data.
This allowed us to move away from mocking the main function or selling point of our product, and set it up legitimately so that it could now be monetized in production, with real customers.
• Led the creation of a web API to manage dashboard projects on an organizational and user level. According to feedback from 20 surveyed beta-customers, this made them feel safer about using the product, as they no longer needed to bookmark links, and they were no longer worried that unauthorized users could access their dashboard if they obtained a link in dishonest circumstances..

Sep 16 – May 17
Fastcom Telecom (Sligo, Ireland) – Technical Support Engineer Fastcom provides network traffic monitoring for businesses and internet for residential customers.

• Through being proactive and regularly checking in with customers, was able to learn about and address customer issues before they became critical. 6 customers called or wrote to say that it was a key factor in them deciding to stay, saving the company $4000 in 2016-17.
• 85% of 300 surveyed customers said they preferred dealing with our tech support team, than that of any other competitor they have previously been a customer with. It’s worth noting we were a 3-person team.

Mar 15 – Aug 15
Fastcom Telecom (Sligo, Ireland) – Web Developer Internship Tech Stack: Java, JavaScript, D3JS, CSS

Specific Achievements:
• Built a self-updating system of known blacklisted IP addresses.
• Built a system which would connect to different remote towers via SSH, run shell commands to record various network-related info, then be used to create email alerts for business customers.
• Built a system which analyses outgoing traffic to known blacklisted IPs and builds a graphic from that data to allow for easy identification of the most severe threats to the system. Proved useful for many of our business clients who we provided internal network monitoring to.
• Created an email alert system so that admins and other relevant bodies were informed of blacklist hits on the network in a timely, effective manner.

Senior Software Engineer

Duration:6 month

Cleveland-OH

Skype

Senior software engineer,
and ideally, this would be someone who can work in both the
mobile and web space.

The role initially will be mobile (which is the focus of the
job description), but will eventually move into a full stack
position which will require working in Go! and Ruby on Rails.

Required Experience:

At a minimum you must have at least 5 years of software engineer
experience. By that we don t mean 5 years of fiddling around as a
hobby. We mean daily experience designing and implementing code.

Having a college degree is important but if you don t have one
then be able to explain why not, we are an understanding group.

Solid OOD skills. Your experience needs to show you have the
ability to design and implement extensible and reusable software.

Experience with Objective-C. This means that you have written one
or more apps using it and that it s taken you at least a year to
write the app (or apps). If that is true then you better know how to
upload the app to Test Flight and understand the nuances or
certificates and provisioning.

Knowledge of what a Cocoa Pod is and how to create and use one.

Knowledge of MVC design pattern and other patterns (e.g., Singleton).

Experience with Xaramin. We know Xaramin hasn t been out for
decades but we require experience with it, including how to upload
an app to the App Store and the Google Play store using it.

Self-driven and focused. You must have the ability to work
remotely without your boss sitting next to you reminding you to turn
the TV off and to stop surfing the web.

Problem solver. Not afraid to solve complex problems and defend
your position. In other words, you have to be technical and be able
to determine which solution is the better solution.

Ability to write documentation. You ll need to understand grammar
and how to construct your thoughts into words that others can understand.

Have a tough skin. Others will review your design and work so
don t pout when they comment on it. Take comments in stride and
learn from them or teach others that their comment was incorrect.

Experience with Git. If you don t know what Git is then take a few
days or a week and get experience.

Experience with macOS and iOS. If you don t have this then you may
not want to apply because we use Apple computers (for better or
worse) as our development machines.

Experience seeing risks in a schedule and knowing when to speak up.

Experience meeting deadlines and not being afraid to but in extra
time during high pressure parts of the project. We understand that
there is more to life than work but we also have to create products
to stay in business which means we have schedules and deadlines. If
you are afraid to push hard during crunch time then this may not be
the place for you.

Preferred Experience:

Experience with encryption on iOS and Android.

Experience with human factors and good UI practices.

Experience with designing and implementing custom UI controls on
iOS and Android.

Experience with data validation and why it is a necessary in any
design, not just good designs.

Experience with client/server design and implementation.
