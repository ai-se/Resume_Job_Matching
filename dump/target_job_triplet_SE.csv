Global Logic India Ltd.

Projects Details:

Client – Verizon
Project – x-MDN
Company: Global Logic India Ltd.
Designation/Role: BigData Developer
Brief: Whenever a mobile device connects to the internet, it is assigned a public IP and correspondingly a pilot packet is generated which is received by collector and it writes record to Kafka. Our system keeps on reading data from Kafka, process each session activity through Spark and update Redis DB accordingly. That is, if a pilot packet allocation record is received then the GIM makes an entry in redis for that particular activity, and when a de-allocation record is received then it removes the corresponding entry from redis. In this way GIM maintains a subscriber base in Redis for all the active connections.

Now whenever the device makes a request for Authentication, the request is interrupted by GSX and get details of the subscriber who has made this request from redis and authenticate device.
My key responsibilities are:
• Continuously reading device data from kafka through spark.
• Filter and parse invalid IP records.
• Validate IPV6 and IPV4 entry.
• Process each session activity and analyze it.
• Store each session activity in redis.

Brief: Whenever a mobile device connects to the internet, it is assigned a public IP and correspondingly a pilot packet is generated which is received by collector and it writes record to Kafka. Our system keeps on reading data from Kafka, process each session activity through Spark and update Redis DB accordingly. That is, if a pilot packet allocation record is received then the GIM makes an entry in redis for that particular activity, and when a de-allocation record is received then it removes the corresponding entry from redis. In this way GIM maintains a subscriber base in Redis for all the active connections.

Now whenever the device makes a request for Authentication, the request is interrupted by GSX and get details of the subscriber who has made this request from redis and authenticate device.
My key responsibilities are:
• Continuously reading device data from kafka through spark.
• Filter and parse invalid IP records.
• Validate IPV6 and IPV4 entry.
• Process each session activity and analyze it.
• Store each session activity in redis.

In this data we will be predicting the classes of the flowers based on numeric parameters that are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length.
NumPy, Pandas and Scikit Learn are some of the inbuilt libraries in Python that we have used.
Using algorithms, we have trained our model to check how accurate every algorithm
K – Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logical Regression,
Random forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine)
Here, Random forest gives optimal accuracy compared to others
By using this we reduce the chances of overfitting and variance in the data which thus lead to better accuracy

1. Iris Dataset:
This data set consists of the physical parameters of three species of flower — Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica.
In this data we will be predicting the classes of the flowers based on numeric parameters that are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length.
NumPy, Pandas and Scikit Learn are some of the inbuilt libraries in Python that we have used.
Using algorithms, we have trained our model to check how accurate every algorithm
K – Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logical Regression,
Random forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine)
Here, Random forest gives optimal accuracy compared to others
By using this we reduce the chances of overfitting and variance in the data which thus lead to better accuracy

This data contains 1460 training data points & 80 features that might help us predict the selling price of a house.
To apply data preprocessing and preparation
techniques
Exploratory data analysis allows us to understand the data and the relationships between variables
better
Correlation between variables helps us to predictor variables are correlated with the target variable
Build machine learning models able to predict house price based on Algorithms: - Linear Regression,
Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression,
Decision Tress, Neural Networks, Random Forest
Choose an algorithm that implements the
corresponding technique
To analyze and compare models’ performance in
order to choose the best model

Dear Sir,
I have been doing computer and network infrastructure support for many years, primarily in the SMB marketplace. While my focus has been on the entire enterprise from a technical perspective, from an entrepreneurial perspective I know what needs to be done across the entire infrastructure ……which can now, seamlessly extend to and include the ‘cloud’. Please understand this…I can walk into a shell of a building and completely install and setup the entire network including all the servers…and be responsible for that organization! I have enough understanding and resources that I can fully support and\or relocate an entire office and put it anywhere on the planet it needs to be.
I’ve gotten pretty resourceful and I know what works and especially, products and services that are reliable. I can think on my feet and work under pressure! I would like to make the transition back into corporate IT and/or management and feel I have a lot of experience and intellect to offer, especially with all the experience I’ve gained I know what to watch out for. Since I do have a lot of firsthand experience, I know all the industry related nuances. Please give me a call either way. I have a very diverse background with a lot of experience in many areas including DFARS, NIST 800-171 and SCIF related standards. I can do what you’re asking for…and very likely, more! Look forward to meeting you.
Thanks,
Rick McClure

***** ****** **** **.,
Dallas, TX 75240
Dear Sir,
I have been doing computer and network infrastructure support for many years, primarily in the SMB marketplace. While my focus has been on the entire enterprise from a technical perspective, from an entrepreneurial perspective I know what needs to be done across the entire infrastructure ……which can now, seamlessly extend to and include the ‘cloud’. Please understand this…I can walk into a shell of a building and completely install and setup the entire network including all the servers…and be responsible for that organization! I have enough understanding and resources that I can fully support and\or relocate an entire office and put it anywhere on the planet it needs to be.
I’ve gotten pretty resourceful and I know what works and especially, products and services that are reliable. I can think on my feet and work under pressure! I would like to make the transition back into corporate IT and/or management and feel I have a lot of experience and intellect to offer, especially with all the experience I’ve gained I know what to watch out for. Since I do have a lot of firsthand experience, I know all the industry related nuances. Please give me a call either way. I have a very diverse background with a lot of experience in many areas including DFARS, NIST 800-171 and SCIF related standards. I can do what you’re asking for…and very likely, more! Look forward to meeting you.
Thanks,
Rick McClure

Experience

Associate Consultant Nov 2018 - Present
Global Logic India Ltd.

Projects Details:

Client – Verizon
Project – x-MDN
Company: Global Logic India Ltd.
Designation/Role: BigData Developer
Brief: Whenever a mobile device connects to the internet, it is assigned a public IP and correspondingly a pilot packet is generated which is received by collector and it writes record to Kafka. Our system keeps on reading data from Kafka, process each session activity through Spark and update Redis DB accordingly. That is, if a pilot packet allocation record is received then the GIM makes an entry in redis for that particular activity, and when a de-allocation record is received then it removes the corresponding entry from redis. In this way GIM maintains a subscriber base in Redis for all the active connections.

Now whenever the device makes a request for Authentication, the request is interrupted by GSX and get details of the subscriber who has made this request from redis and authenticate device.
My key responsibilities are:
• Continuously reading device data from kafka through spark.
• Filter and parse invalid IP records.
• Validate IPV6 and IPV4 entry.
• Process each session activity and analyze it.
• Store each session activity in redis.
• Generate traps and alert through Prometheus and Pushgateway.
• Write workflow and coordinator to schedule job through Oozie.

List of the projects practiced during the Data Analyst training:
Python projects:
1. Iris Dataset:
This data set consists of the physical parameters of three species of flower — Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica.
In this data we will be predicting the classes of the flowers based on numeric parameters that are Sepal width, Sepal length, Petal width and Petal length.
NumPy, Pandas and Scikit Learn are some of the inbuilt libraries in Python that we have used.
Using algorithms, we have trained our model to check how accurate every algorithm
K – Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logical Regression,
Random forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine)
Here, Random forest gives optimal accuracy compared to others
By using this we reduce the chances of overfitting and variance in the data which thus lead to better accuracy
2. House Price Prediction:
Thousands of houses are sold every day. There are some questions every buyer asks himself like: What is the actual price that this house
This data contains 1460 training data points & 80 features that might help us predict the selling price of a house.
To apply data preprocessing and preparation
techniques
Exploratory data analysis allows us to understand the data and the relationships between variables
better
Correlation between variables helps us to predictor variables are correlated with the target variable
Build machine learning models able to predict house price based on Algorithms: - Linear Regression,
Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression,
Decision Tress, Neural Networks, Random Forest
Choose an algorithm that implements the
corresponding technique
To analyze and compare models’ performance in
order to choose the best model
R projects:
1. Movie Recommendation System:
To build a recommendation engine that
recommends movies to users
A recommendation system provides suggestions to
the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history.
In our Data Science project, we will make use of these four packages – ‘recommenderlab’,
‘ggplot2’, ‘data.table’ and ‘reshape2’.
Data pre-Processing will help to make the finalized dataset to build the model by using One-hot encoding
We will implement a single model– Item Based
Collaborative Filtering.
Explore the most viewed movies in our dataset
Data Normalization is a data preparation procedure to standardize the numerical values in a column to a
common scale value
The algorithm first builds a similar-items table of the customers who have purchased them into a
combination of similar items. This is then fed into the recommendation system
