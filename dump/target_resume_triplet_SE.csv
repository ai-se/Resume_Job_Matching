1)Two wheeler works on GAS Kit

The GAS KIT FOR TWO WHEELER Mechanical Mini Project has focused on the use of fuel in two stroke Gasoline engine. The goal of the project is to utilize non-conventional fuel and conventional fuel that has become expensive and insufficient today. This has resulted in less air pollution than conventional fuels which is better based on considerations of economic.
We have used LPG fuel system, two stroke vehicle, gasoline, and LPG in this project. LPG includes the adjustable regulator from storage tank with the transfer of valve present in the LPG cylinder.
LPG is abbreviated as Liquefied Petroleum Gas which is also known as bottled gas (or) Refinery gas. This is formed like a byproduct on bashing heavy crude oils or natural gas. The LPG is produced by bashing or dehydration of CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), desulphurised, or organic sulphide (Mercaptans).
2)Multi Nut Remover

Multi nut remover is a kit invented to reduce the effort and time in replacing the wheels of the vehicle. The plurality of lug nuts can be removed at one time without the usage of an electric motor or any hydraulic and pneumatic devices. The planetary shafts are arranged exactly in the pitch circle position of the lug nuts. This method can be used to remove any number of lug nuts but the design of gear varies according to the certain parameters like number of lug nuts, pitch circle diameter.
3)Design and optimization of Piston using ANSYS and CATIA software
Design, Analysis and optimization of piston which is stronger, lighter with minimum cost and with less time. Since the design and weight of the piston influence the engine performance. Study Design: Analysis of the stress distribution in the various parts of the piston to know the stresses due to the gas pressure and thermal variations using with Ansys. Methodology: The Piston of an engine is designed, analyzed and optimized by using graphics software. The CATIA V5R16, CAD software for performing the design phase and ANSYS 11.0 for analysis and optimization phases are used.
