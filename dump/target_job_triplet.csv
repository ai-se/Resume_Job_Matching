That is, if a pilot packet allocation record is received then the GIM makes an entry in redis for that particular activity, and when a de-allocation record is received then it removes the corresponding entry from redis. In this way GIM maintains a subscriber base in Redis for all the active connections.

Now whenever the device makes a request for Authentication, the request is interrupted by GSX and get details of the subscriber who has made this request from redis and authenticate device.
My key responsibilities are:
• Continuously reading device data from kafka through spark.
• Filter and parse invalid IP records.
• Validate IPV6 and IPV4 entry.
• Process each session activity and analyze it.
• Store each session activity in redis.
• Generate traps and alert through Prometheus and Pushgateway.
• Write workflow and coordinator to schedule job through Oozie.

Projects Details:

Client – Verizon
Project – x-MDN
Company: Global Logic India Ltd.
Designation/Role: BigData Developer
Brief: Whenever a mobile device connects to the internet, it is assigned a public IP and correspondingly a pilot packet is generated which is received by collector and it writes record to Kafka. Our system keeps on reading data from Kafka, process each session activity through Spark and update Redis DB accordingly. That is, if a pilot packet allocation record is received then the GIM makes an entry in redis for that particular activity, and when a de-allocation record is received then it removes the corresponding entry from redis. In this way GIM maintains a subscriber base in Redis for all the active connections.

Now whenever the device makes a request for Authentication, the request is interrupted by GSX and get details of the subscriber who has made this request from redis and authenticate device.
My key responsibilities are:
• Continuously reading device data from kafka through spark.
• Filter and parse invalid IP records.
• Validate IPV6 and IPV4 entry.
• Process each session activity and analyze it.
• Store each session activity in redis.
• Generate traps and alert through Prometheus and Pushgateway.
• Write workflow and coordinator to schedule job through Oozie.

ACADEMIC PROJECT UNDERTAKEN
Project Name: Securing Online Reputation System
Environment: Windows XP/7, Java/J2EE
Project Description:
Combining mobile platforms such as manned or unmanned vehicles and peer-assisted wireless communication is an enabler for a vast number of applications. Routing packets in fully connected mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has been studied to a great extent, but the assumption on full connectivity is generally not valid in a real system. This case means that a practical routing protocol must handle intermittent connectivity and the absence of end-to-end connections. In this system we propose a geographical routing algorithm called location-aware routing for delay-tolerant networks (LAROD), enhanced with a location service, location dissemination service (LoDiS), which together are shown to suit an intermittently connected MANET (IC-MANET).

Ladle Slag Detection Project, AMEPA
Slag detection is a major process problem in steel making industry. Mixing slag with molten steel deteriorates the quality of the final product and destroys refractories. I have been assigned the task to install, commission and integrate AMEPA ladle slag detection system into continuous casting machine process control system. PLC and HMI programming has been done to integrate the system in our industrial automation network. Communication (PROFIBUS and Ethernet) has been established between slag detection system and process control network to exchange data. Project was a complete success. Operation was smooth. System integration was a success. We managed to exchange data and receive the status of the slag detection system during operation.

BAGHOUSE (Fume Treatment Plant) Optimization
Energy saving, is the BAGHOUSE Optimization project main target. To achieve this task, we are planning to automatically control the percentage of opening of Meltshop plant fume dampers, control the speeds of medium voltage suction motors and burn the dioxins and furans organic particles. I have been assigned the task of reviewing PLC programming, instrumentations’ and drawings of Consteel and Baghouse. Quenching tower area of the Consteel plant has been completely recommissioned, new sensors have been added, A lot of modifications have been made in Consteel and BAGHOUSE PLCs. Drawings have been reviewed and modified. It is still ongoing project.
Operating hot billets in billet conditioning machine
The main target is to be able to operate hot billets until it reaches the final inspection table. The main challenge is the very high temperature of the hot billets. It can reach up to 470OC. Such a temperature can easily destroy photo electric cells which define the exact location at which the billet will be stopped on the inspection roller table. We had to investigate the options for new types of sensor which can measure the distance of the approaching hot billet. Laser distance sensor has been employed. Laser beam comes out from the sensor and the reflection of it from the billet cross section of the hot billet defines the distance travelled by the billet on roller table. At a certain st-point billet is stopped.
New transformers integration into IVACO substation
Aging transformers, T1 & T2, are being replaced with new ones. The main challenge is to integrate the new transforms in the old substation. Drawings for the existing control, protection and paralleling circuits. Complete analysis of the existing system is being done. New interconnection drawings for connecting new transformers with substation will be created. Communication between transformers’ signals and load controller PLC will be established. Finally, commissioning and energizing will be done.
