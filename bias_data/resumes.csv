Routing packets in fully connected mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has been studied to a great extent, but the assumption on full connectivity is generally not valid in a real system. This case means that a practical routing protocol must handle intermittent connectivity and the absence of end-to-end connections. In this system we propose a geographical routing algorithm called location-aware routing for delay-tolerant networks (LAROD), enhanced with a location service, location dissemination service (LoDiS), which together are shown to suit an intermittently connected MANET (IC-MANET).\n\nPERSONAL DETAILS\nName : NIHARIKA.G\nDate of Birth : 1ST July, 1994\nGender : Female\nNationality : Indian\nMarital Status : Married\nLanguages : Telugu, English & Hindi\nPermanent Address:\nNIHARIKA.G\nCINEMA HALL CENTRE,\nGUDLURU (POST, MANDAL),\nPRAKASAM DIST,\nANDHRA PRADESH.\n\nNIHARIKA.G\n\nContact this candidate\n'",Software Engineer,set(['Software Engineer']),female

Our system keeps on reading data from Kafka, process each session activity through Spark and update Redis DB accordingly. That is, if a pilot packet allocation record is received then the GIM makes an entry in redis for that particular activity, and when a de-allocation record is received then it removes the corresponding entry from redis. In this way GIM maintains a subscriber base in Redis for all the active connections.\n\nNow whenever the device makes a request for Authentication, the request is interrupted by GSX and get details of the subscriber who has made this request from redis and authenticate device.\nMy key responsibilities are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continuously reading device data from kafka through spark.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Filter and parse invalid IP records.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Validate IPV6 and IPV4 entry.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Process each session activity and analyze it.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Store each session activity in redis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Generate traps and alert through Prometheus and Pushgateway.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Write workflow and coordinator to schedule job through Oozie.\n\nSenior Software Developer Dec 2017 - Present\nImpetus Infotech (India) Pvt Ltd.\n\nProjects Details:\n\nClient \xe2\x80\x93 American Express (Amex)\nProject \xe2\x80\x93 Global Events and Triggers\nCompany: Impetus InfoTech (India) Pvt.

He has a solid understanding of engineering principles, in particular, related to the oil and gas sector. What I found valuable while working with Rito is the good commercial acumen he possesses, and importantly, a calm nature and clear mind while working under pressure. I would recommend Rito for a role where commercial decision making within a technical industry in a segment that is going through change needs a solid and reliable decision maker to drive results.\n\nKim Dumagco\nRetail Territory Manager at Shell\nJanuary 26, 2018, Kim reported directly to Rito\n\nI consider working with Sir Rex as an important part of my early years in the sales industry, particularly in the Petroleum. Sir Rex became one of my line managers in Mawab. He handled five talented sales individuals including me. Coming from different multinational companies including Total, he brought a lot of Global standards to a local company when it comes to work ethic, values, disciplines, and performance. Sir Rex was definitely not just an experienced Manager but an asset to Mawab back then. As a Boss, he was very passionate in delivering performance and growth not just to the company but to all of his subordinates as well. He has very good skills in managing and handling people. In fact, I consider him as a people person with high capacity of a strategic thinker. His coaching skills add up to his list of his managerial competencies. He goes well with millennial and I think that is an advantage. Another good quality of Sir Rex is that he is data driven. He knows how to analyze and present data to his team and translate it to workable plan. And most of the time, his decisions were based on insights derived from data. Sir Rex has the right attitude and mindset of a good Manager/Boss. He can bring out the best in you if let him coach you and help you. Working with him helped me acquire necessary skills which I consider as part of my current knowledge and ability right now. As a produce of Sir Rex, I am now working for the single-biggest branded petroleum company in the world as a Retail Territory Manager, and I would not be able to reach this point if I did not met Sir Rex and became his subordinate. I recommend him to companies needing a valuable asset because I know he possess high capacity, experience, and potential.\n\nContact this candidate\n'",Engineer,set(['Engineer']),male

These generating units need to supply power according to the rules of the grid. These rules involve maintaining a voltage variation within limits and also the frequency.If any deviation from the acceptable limit of the grid it is mandatory that the same feeder should automatically get disconnected from the grid which by effect is termed as islanding. This prevents in large scale brown out or black out of the grid power. So it is preferable to have a system which can warn the grid in advance so that alternate arrangements are kept on standby to avoid complete grid failure.\nThis system is based on a microcontroller of 8051 family. The microcontroller monitors the under/over voltage being derived from a set of comparators. As the frequency of the mains supply cannot be changed, the project uses a variable frequency generator (555-timer) for changing the frequency, while a standard variac is used to vary the input voltage to test the functioning of the project.\nA lamp load (indicating a predictable blackout, brownout) being driven from the microcontroller in case of voltage/frequency going out of acceptable range\nACADEMIC QUALIFICATION\nBachelor of Technology Electrical Engineering 4 Year Program (First Division) From University of Engineering & Technology Peshawar KPK Pakistan (Degree Acknowledge from NATIONAL TECHNALOLGY COUNCIAL PAKISTAN)\n(Session Annual 2010 to 2014)\nThree year Diploma of Associate Engineer Electrical Technology (first Division) Board of Technical Education Peshawar KPK Pakistan.\n(Session Annual 2007 to 2010)\nSecondary School Certificate from Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Dara Ismail Khan KPK Pakistan.\n(Session Annual 2006 to 2007)\n\nSubjects/Skills\nStudied a vast array of subjects related to Electrical, Power, Electronics and Control engineering.
